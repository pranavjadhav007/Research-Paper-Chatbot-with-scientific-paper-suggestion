unprecedented access to public opinion on elections, news, movies etc. However,
caution must be taken to determine whether and how much of the opinion
extracted from OSN user data is indeed reflective of the opinion of the larger
online population. In this work we study this issue in the context of movie
reviews on Twitter and compare the opinion of Twitter users with that of the
online population of IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. We introduce new metrics to show
that the Twitter users can be characteristically different from general users,
both in their rating and their relative preference for Oscar-nominated and
non-nominated movies. Additionally, we investigate whether such data can truly
predict a movie's box-office success.

model which captures the notion of algorithm is computationally equivalent to
the Turing machine. This equivalence usually holds both at a computability
level and at a computational complexity level modulo polynomial reductions.
However, the situation is less clear in what concerns models of computation
using real numbers, and no analog of the Church-Turing thesis exists for this
case. Recently it was shown that some models of computation with real numbers
were equivalent from a computability perspective. In particular it was shown
that Shannon's General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) is equivalent to
Computable Analysis. However, little is known about what happens at a
computational complexity level. In this paper we shed some light on the
connections between this two models, from a computational complexity level, by
showing that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can
be simulated by GPACs, without the need of using more (space) resources than
those used in the original Turing computation, as long as we are talking about
bounded computations. In other words, computations done by the GPAC are as
space-efficient as computations done in the context of Computable Analysis.

both in theory and practice. The problem has been defined in several ways in
literature and most of them have been proven to be NP-Hard. Due to their high
practical relevancy, several heuristics for graph clustering have been
introduced which constitute a central tool for coping with NP-completeness, and
are used in applications of clustering ranging from computer vision, to data
analysis, to learning. There exist many methodologies for this problem, however
most of them are global in nature and are unlikely to scale well for very large
networks. In this paper, we propose two scalable local approaches for
identifying the clusters in any network. We further extend one of these
approaches for discovering the overlapping clusters in these networks. Some
experimentation results obtained for the proposed approaches are also

vital because the security protocols therein, should be devised to work at the

vital security attributes viz. Confidentiality, Message Integrity and Replay
protection. However, in order to ensure lesser overhead, replay protection is
often not incorporated as part of the link layer security framework. We argue
here, that it is essential to implement replay protection at the link layer
only and devise a simple scheme to do so. We first survey the common approaches
to ensuring replay protection in conventional networks. We also implement the
conventional algorithms for replay protection using the link layer framework
for WSNs viz. TinySec as the underlying platform. Subsequently analyzing their
limitations, we propose a novel Bloom-filter based replay protection algorithm
for unicast communications. We show that our algorithm is better than the other
contemporary approaches for ensuring replay protection in unicast

critical; due to the criticality of the resources in the sensor nodes as well
as due to their ubiquitous and pervasive deployment, with varying attributes
and degrees of security required. The proliferation of the next generation
sensor nodes, has not solved this problem, because of the greater emphasis on
low-cost deployment. In addition, the WSNs use data-centric multi-hop
communication that in turn, necessitates the security support to be devised at
the link layer (increasing the cost of security related operations), instead of
being at the application layer, as in general networks. Therefore, an
energy-efficient link layer security framework is necessitated. There do exists
a number of link layer security architectures that offer some combinations of
the security attributes desired by different WSN applications. However, as we
show in this paper, none of them is responsive to the actual security demands
of the applications. Therefore, we believe that there is a need for
investigating the feasibility of a configurable software-based link layer
security architecture wherein an application can be compiled flexibly, with
respect to its actual security demands. In this paper, we analyze, propose and
experiment with the basic design of such configurable link layer security
architecture for WSNs. We also experimentally evaluate various aspects related
to our scheme viz. configurable block ciphers, configurable block cipher modes
of operations, configurable MAC sizes and configurable replay protection. The
architecture proposed is aimed to offer the optimal level of security at the
minimal overhead, thus saving the precious resources in the WSNs.

nodes that are deployed to sense, process and communicate vital information to
the base station. Due to the stringent constraints on the resources in the
sensor nodes on one hand and due to the communications costs being always
significantly higher than the data processing costs, the WSNs typically, employ
in-network processing, which aims at reducing effectively, the total number of
packets eventually transmitted to the base station. Such innetwork processing
largely employs data aggregation operations that aggregate the data into a
compact representation for further transmission. However, due to the ubiquitous
& pervasive deployment, heavier resource demands of the security protocols and
due to the stringent resource constraints in WSN nodes, the security concerns
in WSNs are even otherwise critical. These concerns assume alarming proportions
when using data aggregation in which the output of the data aggregator nodes
depends on that of various other nodes. Hence, the protocols for data
aggregation have to carefully devised with a constant vigil on ensuring
security of the data. In this paper, based on our survey of the existing
research efforts for ensuring secure data aggregation, we propose a novel
approach using homomorphic encryption and additive digital signatures to
achieve confidentiality, integrity and availability for secure data aggregation

complexity of the following two problems:
  1) Given a 2-regular digraph $D$, decide if it contains two arc-disjoint
branchings B^+_u, B^-_v.
  2) Given a 2-regular digraph D, decide if it contains an out-branching B^+_u

  Both problems are NP-complete for general digraphs. We prove that the first

turns out to be polynomial when we do not prescribe the root in advance. We
also prove that, for 2-regular digraphs, the latter problem is in fact
equivalent to deciding if $D$ contains two arc-disjoint out-branchings. We
generalize this result to k-regular digraphs where we want to find a number of

  appear in Theory of Computing; Proceedings of ACM STOC 2012",,,,quant-ph cs.CC,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Forty years ago, Wiesner pointed out that quantum mechanics raises the
striking possibility of money that cannot be counterfeited according to the
laws of physics. We propose the first quantum money scheme that is (1)
public-key, meaning that anyone can verify a banknote as genuine, not only the
bank that printed it, and (2) cryptographically secure, under a ""classical""
hardness assumption that has nothing to do with quantum money. Our scheme is
based on hidden subspaces, encoded as the zero-sets of random multivariate
polynomials. A main technical advance is to show that the ""black-box"" version
of our scheme, where the polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is
unconditionally secure. Previously, such a result had only been known relative
to a quantum oracle (and even there, the proof was never published). Even in
Wiesner's original setting -- quantum money that can only be verified by the
bank -- we are able to use our techniques to patch a major security hole in
Wiesner's scheme. We give the first private-key quantum money scheme that
allows unlimited verifications and that remains unconditionally secure, even if
the counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank. Our money scheme is
simpler than previous public-key quantum money schemes, including a knot-based
scheme of Farhi et al. The verifier needs to perform only two tests, one in the
standard basis and one in the Hadamard basis -- matching the original intuition
for quantum money, based on the existence of complementary observables. Our
security proofs use a new variant of Ambainis's quantum adversary method, and
several other tools that might be of independent interest.

Mendeley and Web of Science citation, but many altmetric indicators seem to
measure impact mostly orthogonal to citation. Articles cluster in ways that

$u\in \R^M$ of a vector $\bestsignal\in \R^N$ in high-dimensions through a
matrix $\Phi \in \R^{M\times N}$ $(M<N)$. We assume this vector can be well
approximated by $K$ non-zero coefficients (i.e., it is $K$-sparse). In
addition, the nonzero coefficients of $\bestsignal$ can obey additional
structure constraints such as matroid, totally unimodular, or knapsack
constraints, which dub as model-based sparsity. We construct the dense
measurement matrix using a probabilistic method so that it satisfies the
so-called restricted isometry property in the $\ell_2$-norm. While recovery
using such matrices is measurement-optimal as they require the smallest sketch
sizes $\numsam= O(\sparsity \log(\dimension/\sparsity))$, the existing

synchronization techniques. These include conventional pessimistic locking, as
well as optimistic techniques based on conditional synchronization primitives
or transactional memory. Yet, it is unclear which of these approaches better
leverage the concurrency inherent to multi-cores.
  In this paper, we compare the level of concurrency one can obtain by
converting a sequential program into a concurrent one using optimistic or
pessimistic techniques. To establish fair comparison of such implementations,
we introduce a new correctness criterion for concurrent programs, defined
independently of the synchronization techniques they use.
  We treat a program's concurrency as its ability to accept a concurrent
schedule, a metric inspired by the theories of both databases and transactional
memory. We show that pessimistic locking can provide strictly higher
concurrency than transactions for some applications whereas transactions can
provide strictly higher concurrency than pessimistic locks for others. Finally,
we show that combining the benefits of the two synchronization techniques can
provide strictly more concurrency than any of them individually. We propose a
list-based set algorithm that is optimal in the sense that it accepts all
correct concurrent schedules. As we show via experimentation, the optimality in
terms of concurrency is reflected by scalability gains.

magnitude of its Fourier transform, also known as phase retrieval. The problem
arises in many areas of astronomy, crystallography, optics, and coherent
diffraction imaging (CDI). Our main goal is to develop an efficient
reconstruction method based on continuous optimization techniques. Unlike
current reconstruction methods, which are based on alternating projections, our
approach leads to a much faster and more robust method. However, all previous
attempts to employ continuous optimization methods, such as Newton-type
algorithms, to the phase retrieval problem failed. In this work we provide an
explanation for this failure, and based on this explanation we devise a
sufficient condition that allows development of new reconstruction
methods---approximately known Fourier phase. We demonstrate that a rough (up to
$\pi/2$ radians) Fourier phase estimate practically guarantees successful
reconstruction by any reasonable method. We also present a new reconstruction
method whose reconstruction time is orders of magnitude faster than that of the
current method-of-choice in phase retrieval---Hybrid Input-Output (HIO).
Moreover, our method is capable of successful reconstruction even in the

where the relay linearly combines -- over a non-binary finite field -- the
coded sequences from the source nodes. A method based on an EXIT chart analysis
is derived for selecting the best coefficients of the linear combination.
Moreover, it is shown that for different setups of the system, different
coefficients should be chosen in order to improve the performance. This
conclusion contrasts with previous works where a random selection was
considered. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms,
in terms of its gap to the outage probabilities, the previously published joint
network-channel coding approaches. Besides, this gain is achieved by using very
short-length codewords, which makes the scheme particularly attractive for
low-latency applications.

the first time \tau the random walk reaches a given level. Specifically, the

investigated where the infimum is taken over the set of stopping times that are
defined on the observation process.
  When there is no drift, optimal stopping rules are characterized for both
types of observations. When there is a drift, upper and lower bounds on
\inf_\eta \ex|\eta-\tau|^p are established for both types of observations. The
bounds are tight in the large-level regime for noisy observations and in the
large-level-large-delay regime for delayed observations. Noteworthy, for noisy
observations there exists an asymptotically optimal stopping rule that is a
function of a single observation.
  Simulation results are provided that corroborate the validity of the results
for non-asymptotic settings.

algorithms for wireless mesh networks to achieve an improved end-end delay
performance. In particular, we compare 802.11 compatible implementations of a
set of congestion-aware routing protocols against our implementation of state
of the art shortest path routing protocol (SRCR). We implement congestion-aware
routing algorithms Backpressure (BP), Enhanced-Backpressure (E-BP) adapted from
[1], [2] suitably adjusted for 802.11 implementation. We then propose and
implement Congestion Diversity Protocol (CDP) adapted from [3] recognizing the
limitations of BP and E-BP for 802.11-based wireless networks. SRCR solely
utilizes link qualities, while BP relies on queue differential to route
packets. CDP and E-BP rely on distance metrics which take into account queue
backlogs and link qualities in the network. E-BP computes its metric by summing
the ETX and queue differential, while CDP determines its metric by calculating
the least draining time to the destination. Our small testbed consisting of
twelve 802.11g nodes enables us to empirically compare the performance of
congestion-aware routing protocols (BP, E-BP and CDP) against benchmark SRCR.
For medium to high load UDP traffic, we observe that CDP exhibits significant
improvement with respect to both end-end delay and throughput over other
protocols with no loss of performance for TCP traffic. Backpressure-based
routing algorithms (BP and E-BP) show poorer performance for UDP and TCP
traffic. Finally, we carefully study the effects of the modular approach to
congestion-aware routing design in which the MAC layer is left intact

an optimization problem. Rather than solving this non-concave maximization
problem, we derive upper and lower bounds for the optimal rate. A cut-set like
upper bound is obtained in a closed form for a layered relay network. A
pseudo-optimal AF scheme is developed for a two-hop parallel network, which is
different from the conventional scheme with all amplification gains chosen as
the maximum possible values. The conditions under which either the novel scheme
or the conventional one achieves a rate within half a bit of the upper bound
are found. Then we provide an AF-based multi-hop ANC scheme with the two
schemes for a layered relay network. It is demonstrated that the lower bound of
the optimal rate can asymptotically achieve the upper bound when the network is
in the generalized high-SNR regime. In the second part, the optimal rate region
for a two-hop multiple access channel (MAC) via AF relays is investigated. In a
similar manner, we first derive an outer bound for it and then focus on
designing low complexity AF-based ANC schemes for different scenarios. Several
examples are given and the numerical results indicate that the achievable rate

data-hiding for security in camera surveillance. While most previous approaches
have focused on completely encrypting the video stream, we introduce a spatial
encryption scheme by blurring the image/video contents to create a CBP. Our
goal is to obscure detail in public video streams by blurring while allowing
behavior to be recognized and to quickly deblur the stream so that details are
available if behavior is recognized as suspicious. We create a CBP by blurring
the same latent image with two unknown kernels. The two kernels are coprime
when mapped to bivariate polynomials in the z domain. To deblur the CBP we
first use the coprime constraint to approximate the kernels and sample the
bivariate CBP polynomials in one dimension on the unit circle. At each sample
point, we factor the 1D polynomial pair and compose the results into a 2D
kernel matrix. Finally, we compute the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of
the kernel matrices to recover the coprime kernels and then the latent video
stream. It is therefore only possible to deblur the video stream if a user has
access to both streams. To improve the practicability of our algorithm, we
implement our algorithm using a graphics processing unit (GPU) to decrypt the
blurred video streams in real-time, and extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our new scheme can effectively protect sensitive identity
information in surveillance videos and faithfully reconstruct the unblurred
video stream when two blurred sequences are available.

prover-verifier interactions under parallel repetition when quantum information
is allowed, and the verifier acts independently in them.
  We first consider the case in which a value is associated with each of the
possible outcomes of an interaction. We prove that it is not possible for the
prover to improve on the optimum average value per repetition by repeating the
protocol multiple times in parallel.
  We look then at games in which the outcomes are classified into two types,
winning outcomes and losing outcomes. We ask what is the optimal probability
for the prover of winning at least k times out of n parallel repetitions, given
that the optimal probability of winning when only one repetition is considered
is $p$. A reasonable conjecture for the answer would be \sum_{m \geq k} {n
\choose m} p^m (1-p)^{n-m}, as that is the answer when it is optimal for the
prover to act independently. This is known to be the correct answer when k=n,
and also in the classical case. It is also correct in some generalizations of
the classical case that we will discuss later. We will show how this cannot be
extended to all cases, presenting an example of an interaction with k=1,n=2 in
which p\approx 0.85, but it is possible to always win at least once. We will
then give some upper bounds on the optimal probability for the prover of
winning k times out of n parallel repetitions. These bounds are expressed as a
function of p.
  Finally, we will connect our results to the study of error reduction for

They are used for
detection and localization of change for the purpose of anomaly detection,
monitoring, or planning. Distance queries are particularly useful when data
sets such as measurements, snapshots of a system, content, traffic matrices,
and activity logs are collected repeatedly.
  Random sampling, which can be efficiently performed over streamed or
distributed data, is an important tool for scalable data analysis. The sample
constitutes an extremely flexible summary, which naturally supports domain
queries and scalable estimation of statistics, which can be specified after the
sample is generated. The effectiveness of a sample as a summary, however,
hinges on the estimators we have.
  We derive novel estimators for estimating $L_p$ distance from sampled data.
Our estimators apply with the most common weighted sampling schemes: Poisson
Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) and its fixed sample size variants. They
also apply when the samples of different data sets are independent or
coordinated. Our estimators are admissible (Pareto optimal in terms of
variance) and have compelling properties.
  We study the performance of our Manhattan and Euclidean distance ($p=1,2$)
estimators on diverse datasets, demonstrating scalability and accuracy even
when a small fraction of the data is sampled. Our work, for the first time,
facilitates effective distance estimation over sampled data.

(2k-1) competitive. However the best known implementation of WFA requires time
O(i^2) to process request r_i and this makes WFA impractical for long sequences
of requests. The O(i^2) time is spent to compute the work function on the whole
history of past requests. In order to make constant the time to process a
request, Rudec and Menger proposed to restrict the history to a moving window
of fixed size. However WFA restricted to a moving window loses its
competitiveness. Here we give a condition that allows WFA to forget the whole
previous history and restart from scratch without losing competitiveness.
Moreover for most of the metric spaces of practical interest (finite or bounded
spaces) there is a constant bound on the length of the history before the
condition is verified and this makes O(1) the time to process each request.

short-length codewords that permits balancing the tradeoff between the bit
error rate floor and waterfall region by modifying a single real-valued
parameter. The proposed approach is based on combining convolutional coding
with a $q$-ary linear combination and unequal energy allocation, the latter
being controlled by the aforementioned parameter. EXIT charts are used to shed
light on the convergence characteristics of the associated iterative decoder,
which is described in terms of factor graphs. Simulation results show that the
proposed scheme is able to adjust its end-to-end error rate performance
efficiently and easily, on the contrary to previous approaches that require a
full code redesign when the error rate requirements of the application change.
Simulations also show that, at mid-range bit-error rates, there is a small
performance penalty with respect to the previous approaches. However, the EXIT
chart analysis and the simulation results suggest that for very low bit-error
rates the proposed system will exhibit lower error floors than previous
approaches.

To appear: LiCS 2012,,10.1109/LICS.2012.35,,quant-ph cs.LO math.CT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Categorical quantum mechanics studies quantum theory in the framework of
dagger-compact closed categories.
  Using this framework, we establish a tight relationship between two key
quantum theoretical notions: non-locality and complementarity. In particular,
we establish a direct connection between Mermin-type non-locality scenarios,
which we generalise to an arbitrary number of parties, using systems of
arbitrary dimension, and performing arbitrary measurements, and a new stronger
notion of complementarity which we introduce here.
  Our derivation of the fact that strong complementarity is a necessary
condition for a Mermin scenario provides a crisp operational interpretation for
strong complementarity. We also provide a complete classification of strongly
complementary observables for quantum theory, something which has not yet been
achieved for ordinary complementarity.
  Since our main results are expressed in the (diagrammatic) language of
dagger-compact categories, they can be applied outside of quantum theory, in
any setting which supports the purely algebraic notion of strongly
complementary observables. We have therefore introduced a method for discussing
non-locality in a wide variety of models in addition to quantum theory.
  The diagrammatic calculus substantially simplifies (and sometimes even
trivialises) many of the derivations, and provides new insights. In particular,
the diagrammatic computation of correlations clearly shows how local
measurements interact to yield a global overall effect. In other words, we
depict non-locality.

performance trade-off between centralized and distributed processing. In our
model, a fraction $p$ of an available resource is deployed in a centralized
manner (e.g., to serve a most-loaded station) while the remaining fraction
$1-p$ is allocated to local servers that can only serve requests addressed
specifically to their respective stations.
  Using a fluid model approach, we demonstrate a surprising phase transition in
the steady-state delay, as $p$ changes: in the limit of a large number of
stations, and when any amount of centralization is available ($p>0$), the
average queue length in steady state scales as $\log_{1/(1-p)} 1/(1-\lambda)$
when the traffic intensity $\lambda$ goes to 1. This is exponentially smaller
than the usual M/M/1-queue delay scaling of $1/(1-\lambda)$, obtained when all
resources are fully allocated to local stations ($p=0$). This indicates a
strong qualitative impact of even a small degree of centralization.
  We prove convergence to a fluid limit, and characterize both the transient
and steady-state behavior of the finite system, in the limit as the number of
stations $N$ goes to infinity. We show that the sequence of queue-length
processes converges to a unique fluid trajectory (over any finite time
interval, as $N$ approaches infinity, and that this fluid trajectory converges
to a unique invariant state $v^I$, for which a simple closed-form expression is
obtained. We also show that the steady-state distribution of the $N$-server
system concentrates on $v^I$ as $N$ goes to infinity.

This paper presents an object shape representation using Kernel Density Feature

applied to the vector of the image. KDFPE is invariant to translation, scale

This is less
obvious for engineering networks (electric power, gas, water, transportation
systems etc.) that are expected to operate under normal conditions most of
time. As a result, the ability of a network to withstand massive sudden damage
caused by adverse events (or survivability) has not been among traditional
goals in the network design. Reality, however, calls for the adjustment of
design priorities. As modern networks develop toward increasing their size,
complexity, and integration, the likelihood of adverse events increases too due
to technological development, climate change, and activities in the political
arena among other factors. Under such circumstances, a network failure has an
unprecedented effect on lives and economy. To mitigate the impact of adverse
events on the network operability, the survivability analysis must be conducted
at the early stage of the network design. Such analysis requires the
development of new analytical and computational tools. Computational analysis
of the network survivability is the exponential time problem at least. The
current paper describes a new algorithm, in which the reduction of the
computational complexity is achieved by mapping an initial network topology
with multiple sources and sinks onto a set of simpler smaller topologies with
multiple sources and a single sink. Steps for further reducing the time and
space expenses of computations are also discussed.

This problem includes environments where agents have budgets, risk preferences,
or multi-dimensional preferences over several possible configurations of the
good (furthermore, it allows an agent's budget and risk preference to be known
only privately to the agent). These are the main challenge areas for auction
theory. A single-agent problem is to optimize a given objective subject to a
constraint on the maximum probability with which each type is allocated,
a.k.a., an allocation rule. Our approach is a reduction from multi-agent
mechanism design problem to collection of single-agent problems. We focus on
maximizing revenue, but our results can be applied to other objectives (e.g.,
welfare).
  An optimal multi-agent mechanism can be computed by a linear/convex program
on interim allocation rules by simultaneously optimizing several single-agent
mechanisms subject to joint feasibility of the allocation rules. For
single-unit auctions, Border \citeyearpar{B91} showed that the space of all
jointly feasible interim allocation rules for $n$ agents is a
$\NumTypes$-dimensional convex polytope which can be specified by $2^\NumTypes$
linear constraints, where $\NumTypes$ is the total number of all agents' types.
Consequently, efficiently solving the mechanism design problem requires a
separation oracle for the feasibility conditions and also an algorithm for
ex-post implementation of the interim allocation rules. We show that the
polytope of jointly feasible interim allocation rules is the projection of a
higher dimensional polytope which can be specified by only $O(\NumTypes^2)$
linear constraints. Furthermore, our proof shows that finding a preimage of the
interim allocation rules in the higher dimensional polytope immediately gives
an ex-post implementation.

possibly non-terminating part. We then give a reduction-preserving completion

reduction relation of the system, by which confluence of the original system is
inferred from that of the completed system.

like content optimization, computational advertising, and many more. While
bilinear random effect models (matrix factorization) provide state-of-the-art
performance when minimizing RMSE through a Gaussian response model on explicit
ratings data, applying it to imbalanced binary response data presents
additional challenges that we carefully study in this paper. Data in many
applications usually consist of users' implicit response that are often binary
-- clicking an item or not; the goal is to predict click rates, which is often
combined with other measures to calculate utilities to rank items at runtime of
the recommender systems. Because of the implicit nature, such data are usually
much larger than explicit rating data and often have an imbalanced distribution
with a small fraction of click events, making accurate click rate prediction
difficult. In this paper, we address two problems. First, we show previous
techniques to estimate bilinear random effect models with binary data are less
accurate compared to our new approach based on adaptive rejection sampling,
especially for imbalanced response. Second, we develop a parallel bilinear
random effect model fitting framework using Map-Reduce paradigm that scales to
massive datasets. Our parallel algorithm is based on a ""divide and conquer""
strategy coupled with an ensemble approach. Through experiments on the
benchmark MovieLens data, a small Yahoo! Front Page data set, and a large
Yahoo! Front Page data set that contains 8M users and 1B binary observations,
we show that careful handling of binary response as well as identifiability
issues are needed to achieve good performance for click rate prediction, and
that the proposed adaptive rejection sampler and the partitioning as well as
ensemble techniques significantly improve model performance.

multiple snapshots of an evolving complex network that can help uncover how
dense clusters in a network emerge, combine, split and decay with time. Current
methods for finding communities in a single snapshot are not straightforwardly
generalizable to finding temporal communities since the quality functions used
for finding static communities have highly degenerate landscapes, and the
eventual partition chosen among the many partitions of similar quality is
highly sensitive to small changes in the network. To reliably detect temporal
communities we need not only to find a good community partition in a given
snapshot but also ensure that it bears some similarity to the partition(s)
found in immediately preceding snapshots. We present a new measure of partition
distance called ""estrangement"" motivated by the inertia of inter-node
relationships which, when incorporated into the measurement of partition
quality, facilitates the detection of meaningful temporal communities.
Specifically, we propose the estrangement confinement method, which postulates
that neighboring nodes in a community prefer to continue to share community
affiliation as the network evolves. Constraining estrangement enables us to
find meaningful temporal communities at various degrees of temporal smoothness
in diverse real-world datasets. Specifically, we study the evolution of voting
behavior of senators in the United States Congress, the evolution of proximity
in human mobility datasets, and the detection of evolving communities in
synthetic networks that are otherwise hard to find. Estrangement confinement
thus provides a principled approach to uncovering temporal communities in
evolving networks.

operations per pixel, where \sigma_s is the (effective) width of the spatial
kernel. A fast implementation of the bilateral filter was recently proposed in
[2] that required O(1) operations per pixel with respect to \sigma_s. This was
done by using trigonometric functions for the range kernel of the bilateral
filter, and by exploiting their so-called shiftability property. In particular,
a fast implementation of the Gaussian bilateral filter was realized by
approximating the Gaussian range kernel using raised cosines. Later, it was
demonstrated in [3] that this idea could be extended to a larger class of
filters, including the popular non-local means filter [4]. As already observed
in [2], a flip side of this approach was that the run time depended on the
width \sigma_r of the range kernel. For an image with (local) intensity
variations in the range [0,T], the run time scaled as O(T^2/\sigma^2_r) with
\sigma_r. This made it difficult to implement narrow range kernels,
particularly for images with large dynamic range. We discuss this problem in
this note, and propose some simple steps to accelerate the implementation in
general, and for small \sigma_r in particular.

depends on his type (possibly multidimensional) and on the strategy profile and
where players' types are distributed independently. We show that if their full
information version for any fixed instance of the type profile is a smooth game
then the Price of Anarchy bound implied by the smoothness property, carries
over to the Bayes-Nash Price of Anarchy. We show how some proofs from the
literature (item bidding auctions, greedy auctions) can be cast as smoothness
proofs or be simplified using smoothness. For first price item bidding with
fractionally subadditive bidders we actually manage to improve by much the
existing result \cite{Hassidim2011a} from 4 to $\frac{e}{e-1}\approx 1.58$.
This also shows a very interesting separation between first and second price
item bidding since second price item bidding has PoA at least 2 even under
complete information. For a larger class of Bayesian Games where the strategy
space of a player also changes with his type we are able to show that a
slightly stronger definition of smoothness also implies a Bayes-Nash PoA bound.
We show how weighted congestion games actually satisfy this stronger definition
of smoothness. This allows us to show that the inefficiency bounds of weighted
congestion games known in the literature carry over to incomplete versions
where the weights of the players are private information. We also show how an
incomplete version of a natural class of monotone valid utility games, called
effort market games are universally $(1,1)$-smooth. Hence, we show that
incomplete versions of effort market games where the abilities of the players
and their budgets are private information has Bayes-Nash PoA at most 2.

strings, subsets, permutations, partitions, vector spaces, and designs. One
generalization of universal cycles, which require almost complete overlap of
consecutive words, is s-overlap cycles, which relax such a constraint. In this
paper we study weak orders, which are relations that are transitive and
complete. We prove the existence of universal and s-overlap cycles for weak
orders, as well as for fixed height and/or weight weak orders, and apply the
results to cycles for ordered partitions as well.

finite statistical mixtures of exponential families such as Gaussian mixture
models. Mixture models are traditionally learned using the
expectation-maximization (EM) soft clustering technique that monotonically
increases the incomplete (expected complete) likelihood. Given prescribed
mixture weights, the hard clustering $k$-MLE algorithm iteratively assigns data
to the most likely weighted component and update the component models using
Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs). Using the duality between exponential
families and Bregman divergences, we prove that the local convergence of the
complete likelihood of $k$-MLE follows directly from the convergence of a dual
additively weighted Bregman hard clustering. The inner loop of $k$-MLE can be
implemented using any $k$-means heuristic like the celebrated Lloyd's batched
or Hartigan's greedy swap updates. We then show how to update the mixture
weights by minimizing a cross-entropy criterion that implies to update weights
by taking the relative proportion of cluster points, and reiterate the mixture
parameter update and mixture weight update processes until convergence. Hard EM
is interpreted as a special case of $k$-MLE when both the component update and
the weight update are performed successively in the inner loop. To initialize
$k$-MLE, we propose $k$-MLE++, a careful initialization of $k$-MLE guaranteeing
probabilistically a global bound on the best possible complete likelihood.

transversal aspects such as security, software frameworks, quality of service,

computing vision will lead to the introduction of a virtual market where Cloud
brokers, on behalf of end users, are in charge of selecting and composing the
services advertised by different Cloud vendors. In order to make this happen,
existing solutions and technologies have to be redesigned and extended from a

otherwise, no correction is performed and the algorithm continues with the next
token until all tokens get validated. Experiments carried out on various

organizations have been investing in Information Technology to automate their
internal processes to cut costs and efficiently support their business
projects. However, this comes to a price. Business requirements always change.
Likewise, IT systems constantly evolves as developers make new versions of
them, which require endless administrative manual work to customize and
configure them, especially if they are being used in different contexts, by
different types of users, and for different requirements. Autonomic computing
was conceived to provide an answer to these ever-changing requirements.
Essentially, autonomic systems are self-configuring, self-healing,
self-optimizing, and self-protecting; hence, they can automate all complex IT
processes without human intervention. This paper proposes an autonomic model
based on Venn diagram and set theory for self-configuring C#.NET applications,
namely the self-customization of their GUI, event-handlers, and security
permissions. The proposed model does not require altering the source-code of
the original application; rather, it uses an XML-based customization file to
turn on and off the internal attributes of the application. Experiments
conducted on the proposed model, showed a successful automatic customization
for C# applications and an effective self-adaption based on dynamic business
requirements. As future work, other programming languages such as Java and C++
are to be supported, in addition to other operating systems such as Linux and
Mac so as to provide a standard platform-independent autonomic self-configuring
model.

another type of computational problem whose purpose is to recognize human
spoken speech and convert it into text that can be processed by a computer.
Despite that ASR has many versatile and pervasive real-world applications,it is
still relatively erroneous and not perfectly solved as it is prone to produce
spelling errors in the recognized text, especially if the ASR system is
operating in a noisy environment, its vocabulary size is limited, and its input
speech is of bad or low quality. This paper proposes a post-editing ASR error
correction method based on MicrosoftN-Gram dataset for detecting and correcting
spelling errors generated by ASR systems. The proposed method comprises an
error detection algorithm for detecting word errors; a candidate corrections
generation algorithm for generating correction suggestions for the detected
word errors; and a context-sensitive error correction algorithm for selecting
the best candidate for correction. The virtue of using the Microsoft N-Gram
dataset is that it contains real-world data and word sequences extracted from

storage regenerating (exact-MBR) codes. Both constructions obtain the encoded
symbols by first treating the message vector over GF(q) as a linearized
polynomial and then evaluating it over an extension field GF(q^m). The
evaluation points are chosen so that the encoded symbols at any node are
conjugates of each other, while corresponding symbols of different nodes are
linearly dependent with respect to GF(q). These properties ensure that data
repair can be carried out over the base field GF(q), instead of matrix
inversion over the extension field required by some existing exact-MBR codes.
To the best of our knowledge, this approach is novel in the construction of
exact-MBR codes. One of our constructions leads to exact-MBR codes with
arbitrary parameters. These exact-MBR codes have higher data reconstruction
complexities but lower data repair complexities than their counterparts based
on the product-matrix approach; hence they may be suitable for applications
that need a small number of data reconstructions but a large number of data
repairs.

patterns of the network are at the basis of the mechanisms ruling the network
formation. Connectivity driven models necessarily provide a time-aggregated
representation that may fail to describe the instantaneous and fluctuating
dynamics of many networks. We address this challenge by defining the activity
potential, a time invariant function characterizing the agents' interactions
and constructing an activity driven model capable of encoding the instantaneous
time description of the network dynamics. The model provides an explanation of
structural features such as the presence of hubs, which simply originate from
the heterogeneous activity of agents. Within this framework, highly dynamical
networks can be described analytically, allowing a quantitative discussion of
the biases induced by the time-aggregated representations in the analysis of
dynamical processes.

probing model where $\beta$ fraction of time slot is consumed for acquiring the
channel state information (CSI) of a single channel. In this work, we design a
joint scheduling and channel probing algorithm named SDF by considering the
overhead of obtaining the channel state information. We first analytically
prove SDF algorithm can support $1+\epsilon$ fraction of of the full rate
region achieved when all users are probed where $\epsilon$ depends on the
expected number of users which are not probed. Then, for homogenous channel, we
show that when the number of users in the network is greater than 3, $\epsilon
> 0$, i.e., we guarantee to expand the rate region. In addition, for
heterogenous channels, we prove the conditions under which SDF guarantees to
increase the rate region. We also demonstrate numerically in a realistic
simulation setting that this rate region can be achieved by probing only less

communication systems, such as impulse radio (IR) ultra wide band (UWB) systems
and free space optical (FSO) communications. Using the proposed scheme, the
constellation size and the bit-rate can be increased significantly in these
systems. The symbols are obtained using symmetric balanced incomplete block
designs (BIBD), forming a set of pair-wise equidistance symbols. The
performance of Q-ary EPPM is better than any Q-ary pulse position-based
modulation scheme with the same symbol length. Since the code is cyclic, the
receiver for EPPM is simpler compared to multipulse PPM (MPPM).

compute its connected components efficiently? Recent work addresses this
problem in map-reduce, where a fundamental trade-off exists between the number
of map-reduce rounds and the communication of each round. Denoting d the
diameter of the graph, and n the number of nodes in the largest component, all
prior map-reduce techniques either require d rounds, or require about n|V| +
|E| communication per round. We propose two randomized map-reduce algorithms --
(i) Hash-Greater-To-Min, which provably requires at most 3log(n) rounds with
high probability, and at most 2(|V| + |E|) communication per round, and (ii)
Hash-to-Min, which has a worse theoretical complexity, but in practice
completes in at most 2log(d) rounds and 3(|V| + |E|) communication per rounds.
  Our techniques for connected components can be applied to clustering as well.
We propose a novel algorithm for agglomerative single linkage clustering in
map-reduce. This is the first algorithm that can provably compute a clustering
in at most O(log(n)) rounds, where n is the size of the largest cluster. We
show the effectiveness of all our algorithms through detailed experiments on
large synthetic as well as real-world datasets.

counting for different range spaces is a central problem in Computational

  We study $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithms for range

is, the halfspace counting problem. We present an $(\epsilon,

dimensions which achieves $O(n^{1-1/d})$ average squared error. This contrasts
with the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound established by the classical result of Dinur

matching lower bound on average squared error for any $(\epsilon,

are obtained using discrepancy theory. For the lower bound, we use a modified
discrepancy measure and bound approximation of $(\epsilon,

classical combinatorial discrepancy, which allows us to exploit known
discrepancy lower bounds. This approach also yields a lower bound of
$\Omega((\log n)^{d-1})$ for $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private
orthogonal range counting in $d$ dimensions, the first known superconstant

theories reveal that mutual connections are more stable than one-way
connections, and one-way connections exhibit various tendencies to become
mutual connections. It is therefore important to take such tendencies into
account when performing clustering of social networks with both mutual and
one-way connections.
  In this paper, we utilize the dyadic methods to analyze social networks, and
develop a generalized mutuality tendency theory to capture the tendencies of
those node pairs which tend to establish mutual connections more frequently
than those occur by chance. Using these results, we develop a
mutuality-tendency-aware spectral clustering algorithm to identify more stable
clusters by maximizing the within-cluster mutuality tendency and minimizing the
cross-cluster mutuality tendency. Extensive simulation results on synthetic

demonstrate that our proposed mutuality-tendency-aware spectral clustering
algorithm extracts more stable social community structures than traditional

approximate query engine for running ad-hoc, interactive SQL queries on large
volumes of data. The key insight that BlinkDB builds on is that one can often
make reasonable decisions in the absence of perfect answers. For example,
reliably detecting a malfunctioning server using a distributed collection of
system logs does not require analyzing every request processed by the system.
Based on this insight, BlinkDB allows one to trade-off query accuracy for
response time, enabling interactive queries over massive data by running
queries on data samples and presenting results annotated with meaningful error
bars. To achieve this, BlinkDB uses two key ideas that differentiate it from
previous work in this area: (1) an adaptive optimization framework that builds
and maintains a set of multi-dimensional, multi-resolution samples from
original data over time, and (2) a dynamic sample selection strategy that
selects an appropriately sized sample based on a query's accuracy and/or
response time requirements. We have built an open-source version of BlinkDB and
validated its effectiveness using the well-known TPC-H benchmark as well as a
real-world analytic workload derived from Conviva Inc. Our experiments on a 100

social networks - and to provide new insights on its structure. We argue that:
(a) virality is a phenomenon strictly connected to the nature of the content
being spread, rather than to the influencers who spread it, (b) virality is a
phenomenon with many facets, i.e. under this generic term several different
effects of persuasive communication are comprised and they only partially
overlap. To give ground to our claims, we provide initial experiments in a
machine learning framework to show how various aspects of virality can be
independently predicted according to content features.

wireless physical layer (PHY) that supports cooperative forwarding of
interfered/superimposed packets. Our system model considers multiple and
independent unicast transmissions between network nodes while a number of them
serve as relays of the interfered/superimposed signals. For this new PHY the
average transmission rate that each node can achieve is estimated first. Next,
we formulate a utility optimization framework for the video transmission
problem and we show that it can be simplified due to the features of the new
PHY. Simulation results reveal the system operating regions for which
superimposing wireless packets is a better choice than a typical cooperative
PHY.

  Markov Decision Processes",,,,,cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted Markov Decision Processes,
for which it is known that there exists a stationary optimal policy. We
consider the algorithm Value Iteration and the sequence of policies
$\pi_1,...,\pi_k$ it implicitely generates until some iteration $k$. We provide
performance bounds for non-stationary policies involving the last $m$ generated
policies that reduce the state-of-the-art bound for the last stationary policy
$\pi_k$ by a factor $\frac{1-\gamma}{1-\gamma^m}$. In particular, the use of
non-stationary policies allows to reduce the usual asymptotic performance
bounds of Value Iteration with errors bounded by $\epsilon$ at each iteration
from $\frac{\gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2}\epsilon$ to
$\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}\epsilon$, which is significant in the usual situation
when $\gamma$ is close to 1. Given Bellman operators that can only be computed
with some error $\epsilon$, a surprising consequence of this result is that the
problem of ""computing an approximately optimal non-stationary policy"" is much
simpler than that of ""computing an approximately optimal stationary policy"",
and even slightly simpler than that of ""approximately computing the value of
some fixed policy"", since this last problem only has a guarantee of
$\frac{1}{1-\gamma}\epsilon$.

The model employs advice centrality approach by electing a leader and
recommender named as Supra Decision Maker (SDM). A SDM has a role as a decision
bench-marker to other decision makers in evaluating each alternative with
respect to given criteria. The weighting value for each alternative can be
obtained by considering consensus level and preferences' distances between SDM
and other Decision Makers. A social function using Social Judgment Scheme (SJS)
concept is employed when a decision does not achieve the required consensus
level. A simple example is presented here to illustrate our model.

Michel,Causal conditioning and instantaneous coupling in causality graphs,submitted,,,,cs.IT math.IT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The paper investigates the link between Granger causality graphs recently
formalized by Eichler and directed information theory developed by Massey and
Kramer. We particularly insist on the implication of two notions of causality
that may occur in physical systems. It is well accepted that dynamical
causality is assessed by the conditional transfer entropy, a measure appearing
naturally as a part of directed information. Surprisingly the notion of
instantaneous causality is often overlooked, even if it was clearly understood
in early works. In the bivariate case, instantaneous coupling is measured
adequately by the instantaneous information exchange, a measure that
supplements the transfer entropy in the decomposition of directed information.
In this paper, the focus is put on the multivariate case and conditional graph
modeling issues. In this framework, we show that the decomposition of directed
information into the sum of transfer entropy and information exchange does not
hold anymore. Nevertheless, the discussion allows to put forward the two
measures as pillars for the inference of causality graphs. We illustrate this
on two synthetic examples which allow us to discuss not only the theoretical
concepts, but also the practical estimation issues.

particular, the structural controllability of multi-agent systems under
switching topologies is investigated. The structural controllability of
multi-agent systems is a generalization of the traditional controllability
concept for dynamical systems, and purely based on the communication topologies
among agents. The main contributions of the paper are graph-theoretic
characterizations of the structural controllability for multi-agent systems. It
turns out that the multi-agent system with switching topology is structurally
controllable if and only if the union graph G of the underlying communication
topologies is connected (single leader) or leader-follower connected
(multi-leader). Finally, the paper concludes with several illustrative examples
and discussions of the results and future work.

is to combine noisy network coding with the interference assisted strategy for
wiretap channel with a helping interferer. A new achievable secrecy rate is
characterized for both discrete memoryless and Gaussian channels. Such a new
rate can be viewed as a general framework, where the existing interference
assisted schemes such as noisy-forwarding and cooperative jamming approaches
can be shown as special cases of the proposed scheme. In addition, under some
channel condition where the existing schemes can only achieve zero secrecy
rate, the proposed secrecy scheme can still offer significant performance
gains.

gain is derived. Many closed-form critical conditions for various control
schemes in terms of converter parameters are also derived. Some previously
known critical conditions become special cases in the generalized framework.
Given an arbitrary control scheme, a systematic procedure is proposed to derive
the critical condition for that control scheme. Different control schemes share
similar forms of critical conditions. For example, both V2 control and voltage
mode control have the same form of critical condition. A peculiar phenomenon in
average current mode control where subharmonic oscillation occurs in a window
value of pole can be explained by the derived critical condition. A ripple
amplitude index to predict subharmonic oscillation proposed in the past
research has limited application and is shown invalid for a converter with a
large pole.

  Channels",Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,,10.1109/ISIT.2010.5513511,,cs.IT math.IT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The scalar additive Gaussian noise channel has the ""single crossing point""
property between the minimum-mean square error (MMSE) in the estimation of the
input given the channel output, assuming a Gaussian input to the channel, and
the MMSE assuming an arbitrary input. This paper extends the result to the
parallel MIMO additive Gaussian channel in three phases: i) The channel matrix
is the identity matrix, and we limit the Gaussian input to a vector of Gaussian
i.i.d. elements. The ""single crossing point"" property is with respect to the
snr (as in the scalar case). ii) The channel matrix is arbitrary, the Gaussian
input is limited to an independent Gaussian input. A ""single crossing point""
property is derived for each diagonal element of the MMSE matrix. iii) The
Gaussian input is allowed to be an arbitrary Gaussian random vector. A ""single
crossing point"" property is derived for each eigenvalue of the MMSE matrix.
  These three extensions are then translated to new information theoretic
properties on the mutual information, using the fundamental relationship
between estimation theory and information theory. The results of the last phase
are also translated to a new property of Fisher's information. Finally, the
applicability of all three extensions on information theoretic problems is
demonstrated through: a proof of a special case of Shannon's vector EPI, a
converse proof of the capacity region of the parallel degraded MIMO broadcast
channel (BC) under per-antenna power constrains and under covariance
constraints, and a converse proof of the capacity region of the compound
parallel degraded MIMO BC under covariance constraint.
