 Let \\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n be a bounded domain with C^\\infty boundary. We\nshow that a harmonic function in \\Omega that is Lipschitz along a family of\ncurves transversal to b\\Omega is Lipschitz in \\Omega. The space of Lipschitz\nfunctions we consider is defined using the notion of a majorant which is a\ncertain generalization of the power functions t^\\alpha, 0<\\alpha<1.\n","330001":"  Data from Online Social Networks (OSNs) are providing analysts with an\nunprecedented access to public opinion on elections, news, movies etc. However,\ncaution must be taken to determine whether and how much of the opinion\nextracted from OSN user data is indeed reflective of the opinion of the larger\nonline population. In this work we study this issue in the context of movie\nreviews on Twitter and compare the opinion of Twitter users with that of the\nonline population of IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. We introduce new metrics to show\nthat the Twitter users can be characteristically different from general users,\nboth in their rating and their relative preference for Oscar-nominated and\nnon-nominated movies. Additionally, we investigate whether such data can truly\npredict a movie's box-office success.\n","330002":"  Robust design has been widely recognized as a leading method in reducing\nvariability and improving quality. Most of the engineering statistics\nliterature mainly focuses on finding \"point estimates\" of the optimum operating\nconditions for robust design. Various procedures for calculating point\nestimates of the optimum operating conditions are considered. Although this\npoint estimation procedure is important for continuous quality improvement, the\nimmediate question is \"how accurate are these optimum operating conditions?\"\nThe answer for this is to consider interval estimation for a single variable or\njoint confidence regions for multiple variables.\n  In this paper, with the help of the bootstrap technique, we develop\nprocedures for obtaining joint \"confidence regions\" for the optimum operating\nconditions. Two different procedures using Bonferroni and multivariate normal\napproximation are introduced. The proposed methods are illustrated and\nsubstantiated using a numerical example.\n","330003":"  Transparent conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) thin films, electrochemically\nintercalated with sodium or other cations, show tunable superconducting\ntransitions with a maximum $T_c$ at 5 K. The transition temperature and the\ndensity of states, $D(E_F)$ (extracted from the measured Pauli susceptibility\n$\\chi_p$ exhibit the same dome shaped behavior as a function of electron\ndensity. Optimally intercalated samples have an upper critical field $\\approx\n4$ T and $\\Delta\/{k_BT_c} \\approx 2.0$. Accompanying the development of\nsuperconductivity, the films show a reversible electrochromic change from\ntransparent to colored and are partially transparent (orange) at the peak of\nthe superconducting dome. This reversible intercalation of alkali and alkali\nearth ions into thin ITO films opens diverse opportunities for tunable,\noptically transparent superconductors.\n","330004":"  In this paper we count the number of rows yn with the value \"false\" in the\ntruth tables of all bracketed formulae with n distinct variables connected by\nthe binary connective of 2modified-implication\". We find a recurrence and an\nasymptotic formulae for yn. We also determine the parity of yn.\n","330005":"  We study nonequilibrium dynamics of SU(2) pure gauge theory starting from\ninitial over-population, where intense classical gauge fields are characterized\nby a single momentum scale Q_s. Classical-statistical lattice simulations\nindicate a quick evolution towards an approximate scaling behavior with\nexponent 3\/2 at intermediate times. Remarkably, the value for the scaling\nexponent may be understood as arising from the leading O(g^2) contribution in\nthe presence of a time-dependent background field. The phenomenon is associated\nto weak wave turbulence describing an energy cascade towards higher momenta.\nThis particular aspect is very similar to what is observed for scalar theories,\nwhere an effective cubic interaction arises because of the presence of a\ntime-dependent Bose condensate.\n","330006":"  We derive formulas for the terms in the conjectured asymptotic expansions of\nthe moments, at the central point, of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions,\n$L(1\/2,\\chi_d)$, and also of the $L$-functions associated to quadratic twists\nof an elliptic curve over $\\Q$.

There are two schools of thoughts about the\npairing glue question: One argues that superconductivity in the cuprates\nemerges out of doping the spin singlet resonating valence bond (RVB) state.\nSince singlet pairs are already formed in the RVB state there is no need for\nadditional boson glue to pair the electrons. The other instead suggests that\nthe d-wave pairs are mediated by the collective bosons like the conventional\nlow $T_c$ SC with the alteration that the phonons are replaced by another kind\nof bosons ranging from the antiferromagnetic (AF) to loop current fluctuations.\nAn approach to resolve this dispute is to determine the frequency and momentum\ndependences of the diagonal and off-diagonal self-energies directly from\nexperiments like the McMillan-Rowell procedure for the conventional SC. In that\na simple d-wave BCS theory describes superconducting properties of the cuprates\nwell, the Eliashberg analysis of well designed high resolution experimental\ndata will yield the crucial frequency and momentum dependences of the\nself-energies.

It is a\nsemiconductor or an insulator owing to relatively large spin-orbit interactions\ninduced by its buckled structure. The key observation is that this buckled\nstructure allows us to control the band structure by applying electric field\n$E_z$. When $E_z$ is larger than a certain critical value $E_{\\text{cr}}$, by\nanalyzing the band structure and also on the basis of the effective Dirac\ntheory, we demonstrate the emergence of four helical zero-energy modes\npropagating along nanotube. Accordingly, a silicon nanotube contains three\nregions, namely, a topological insulator, a band insulator and a metallic\nregion separating these two types of insulators. The wave function of each zero\nmode is localized within the metallic region, which may be used as a quantum\nwire to transport spin currents in future spintronics. We present an analytic\nexpression of the wave function for each helical zero mode. These results are\napplicable also to germanium nanotube.\n","330014":"  This sequel to our previous paper [MS11b] continues the study of topological\ncontact dynamics and applications to contact dynamics and topological dynamics.\nWe provide further evidence that the topological automorphism groups of a\ncontact structure and a contact form are the appropriate transformation groups\nof contact dynamical systems. The article includes an examination of the groups\nof time-one maps of topological contact and strictly contact isotopies, and the\nconstruction of a bi-invariant metric on the latter. Moreover, every\ntopological contact or strictly contact dynamical system is arbitrarily close\nto a continuous contact or strictly contact dynamical system with the same end\npoint. In particular, the above groups of time-one maps are independent of the\nchoice of norm in the definition of the contact distance. On every contact\nmanifold we construct topological contact dynamical systems with time-one maps\nthat fail to be Lipschitz continuous, and smooth contact vector fields whose\nflows are topologically conjugate but not conjugate by a contact\nC^1-diffeomorphism.\n","330015":"  We develop a microscopic model for fluorescence of a molecule (or\nsemiconductor quantum dot) near a small metal nanoparticle. When a molecule is\nsituated close to metal surface, its fluorescence is quenched due to energy\ntransfer to the metal. We perform quantum-mechanical calculations of energy\ntransfer rates for nanometer-sized Au nanoparticles and find that non-local and\nquantum-size effects significantly enhance dissipation in metal as compared to\nthose predicted by semiclassical electromagnetic models. However, the\ndependence of transfer rates on molecule's distance to metal nanoparticle\nsurface, $d$, is significantly weaker than the $d^{-4}$ behavior for flat metal\nsurface with a sharp boundary predicted by previous calculations within random\nphase approximation.\n","330016":"  We present an experimental investigation of the dynamic spin response of a\nstrongly interacting Fermi gas using Bragg spectroscopy. By varying the\ndetuning of the Bragg lasers, we show that it is possible to measure the\nresponse in the spin and density channels separately. At low Bragg energies,\nthe spin response is suppressed due to pairing, whereas the density response is\nenhanced. These experiments provide the first independent measurements of the\nspin-parallel and spin-antiparallel dynamic and static structure factors and\nopen the way to a complete study of the structure factors at any momentum. At\nhigh momentum the spin-antiparallel dynamic structure factor displays a\nuniversal high frequency tail, proportional to $\\omega^{-5\/2}$, where $\\hbar\n\\omega$ is the probe energy.\n","330017":"  We study magnetic phases of two-component mixtures of ultracold fermions with\nrepulsive interactions in optical lattices in the presence of hopping\nimbalance.

We show that below the critical temperature for N\\'{e}el order\nmass-imbalanced mixtures also exhibit a charge-density wave, which provides a\ndirectly observable signature of the ordered state. For the trapped system, we\ncompare our results obtained by real-space DMFT to a local-density\napproximation. We calculate the entropy for a wide range of parameters and\nidentify regions, in which mass-imbalanced mixtures could have clear advantages\nover balanced ones for the purpose of obtaining and detecting quantum\nmagnetism.\n","330018":"  The environment surrounding Wolf-Rayet star HD 211853 is studied in molecular\nemission, infrared emission, as well as radio and HI emission. The molecular\nring consists of well-separated cores, which have a volume density of 10$^{3}$\ncm$^{-3}$ and kinematic temperature $\\sim$20 K. Most of the cores are under\ngravitational collapse due to external pressure from the surrounding ionized\ngas. From SED modeling towards the young stellar objects (YSOs), sequential\nstar formation is revealed on a large scale in space spreading from the\nWolf-Rayet star to the molecular ring. A small scale sequential star formation\nis revealed towards core A, which harbors a very young star cluster. Triggered\nstar formations is thus suggested. The presence of PDR, the fragmentation of\nthe molecular ring, the collapse of the cores, the large scale sequential star\nformation indicate the \"Collect and Collapse\" process functions in this region.\nThe star forming activities in core A seem to be affected by the\n\"Radiation-Driven Implosion\" (RDI) process.\n","330019":"  We have measured high-field magnetization and magnetoresistance of\npolycrystalline samples of the A-site ordered perovskite CaCu3Ti4-xRuxO12 (x=0\n- 4) utilizing a non-destructive pulsed magnet. We find that the magnetization\nfor x=0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 is nonlinear, and tends to saturate in high fields. This\nis highly nontrivial because the magnetization for x=0 and 4 is linear in\nexternal field up to the highest one. We have analyzed this field dependence\nbased on the thermodynamics of magnetic materials, and propose that the\nexternal fields delocalize the holes on the Cu2+ ions in order to maximize the\nentropy. This scenario is qualitatively consistent with a large\nmagnetoresistance of -70% observed at 4.2 K at 52 T for x=1.5.\n","330020":"  Classical statistical process control often relies on univariate\ncharacteristics.

This paper develops a\nnovel nonparametric $L$-1 location-scale model to screen the shapes of\nprofiles. The model is built on three basic elements: location shifts, local\nshape distortions, and overall shape deviations, which are quantified by three\nindividual metrics.

For the very small scale spectrum, those which subtend\nangles of less than 0.3 degrees on the sky, an upper bound can be extracted\nfrom the astrophysical constraints on the possible production of primordial\nblack holes in the early universe. A recently discovered observational\nby-product of an enhanced power spectrum on small scales, induced gravitational\nwaves, have been shown to be within the range of proposed space based\ngravitational wave detectors; such as NASA's LISA and BBO detectors, and the\nJapanese DECIGO detector. In this paper we explore the impact such a detection\nwould have on models of inflation known to lead to an enhanced power spectrum\non small scales, namely the Hilltop-type and running mass models. We find that\nthe Hilltop-type model can produce observable induced gravitational waves\nwithin the range of BBO and DECIGO for integral and fractional powers of the\npotential within a reasonable number of e-folds. We also find that the running\nmass model can produce a spectrum within the range of these detectors, but\nrequire that inflation terminates after an unreasonably small number of\ne-folds. Finally, we argue that if the thermal history of the Universe were to\naccomodate such a small number of e-folds the Running Mass Model can produce\nPrimordial Black Holes within a mass range compatible with Dark Matter, i.e.\nwithin a mass range 10^{20}g< M_{BH}<10^{27}g.\n","330023":"  In 1956, Charles Stein published an article that was to forever change the\nstatistical approach to high-dimensional estimation.

As a tribute to Charles Stein, this special issue on minimax\nshrinkage estimation is devoted to developments that ultimately arose from\nStein's investigations into improving on the UMVUE of a multivariate normal\nmean vector.

Recent experiments on reconstituted\nactomyosin networks, the major component of the contractile machinery, have\nshown that active contractility occurs above a threshold motor concentration\nand within a window of crosslink concentration. We present a microscopic\ndynamic model that incorporates two essential aspects of actomyosin\nself-organization: the asymmetric load response of individual actin filaments\nand the correlated motor-driven events mimicking myosin-induced filament\nsliding. Using computer simulations we examine how the concentration and\nsusceptibility of motors contribute to their collective behavior and interplay\nwith the network connectivity to regulate macroscopic contractility. Our model\nis shown to capture the formation and dynamics of contractile structures and\nagree with the observed dependence of active contractility on microscopic\nparameters including the contractility onset. Cooperative action of\nload-resisting motors in a force-percolating structure integrates local\ncontraction\/buckling events into a global contractile state via an active\ncoarsening process, in contrast to the flow transition driven by uncorrelated\nkicks of susceptible motors.\n","330026":"  The Church-Turing thesis states that any sufficiently powerful computational\nmodel which captures the notion of algorithm is computationally equivalent to\nthe Turing machine. This equivalence usually holds both at a computability\nlevel and at a computational complexity level modulo polynomial reductions.\nHowever, the situation is less clear in what concerns models of computation\nusing real numbers, and no analog of the Church-Turing thesis exists for this\ncase. Recently it was shown that some models of computation with real numbers\nwere equivalent from a computability perspective. In particular it was shown\nthat Shannon's General Purpose Analog Computer (GPAC) is equivalent to\nComputable Analysis. However, little is known about what happens at a\ncomputational complexity level. In this paper we shed some light on the\nconnections between this two models, from a computational complexity level, by\nshowing that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can\nbe simulated by GPACs, without the need of using more (space) resources than\nthose used in the original Turing computation, as long as we are talking about\nbounded computations.

The B(GT) strength\ndistributions for ground and excited states of $^{57}$Zn are calculated in the\ndomain of proton-neutron Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (pn-QRPA)\ntheory. No experimental insertions were made (as usually made in other pn-QRPA\ncalculations of B(GT) strength function) to check the performance of the model\nfor proton-rich nuclei. The calculated ground-state B(GT) strength distribution\nis in good agreement with measurements and shows differences with the earlier\nreported shell model calculation. The pn-QRPA model reproduced the measured\nlow-lying strength for $^{57}$Zn better in comparison to the KB3G interaction\nused in the large-scale shell model calculation. The stellar weak rates are\nsensitive to the location and structure of these low-lying states in daughter\n$^{57}$Cu. The primary mechanism for producing such nuclei is the rp-process\nand is believed to be important in the dynamics of the collapsing supermassive\nstars. Small changes in the binding and excitation energies can lead to\nsignificant modifications of the predictions for the synthesis of proton rich\nisotopes. The $\\beta^{+}$-decay and electron capture (EC) rates on $^{57}$Zn\nare compared to the seminal work of Fuller, Fowler and Newman (FFN). The\npn-QRPA calculated $\\beta^{+}$-decay rates are generally in good agreement with\nthe FFN calculation. However at high stellar temperatures the calculated\n$\\beta^{+}$-decay rates are almost half of FFN rates. On the other hand, for\nrp-process conditions, the calculated electron capture ($\\beta^{+}$-decay)\nrates are bigger than FFN rates by more than a factor 2 (1.5) and may have\ninteresting astrophysical consequences.\n","330029":"  Antilinear operators on a complex Hilbert space arise in various contexts in\nmathematical physics.

Experiments performed\non active structures containing near surface quantum dots clearly show that the\npropagating plasmon mode excites the dot, providing a new method to spatially\nimage the surface plasmon mode. We use low temperature confocal microscopy with\npolarization control in the excitation and detection channel. After excitation,\nplasmons propagate along the waveguide and are scattered into the far field at\nthe end. By comparing length and width evolution of the waveguide losses we\ndetermine the plasmon propagation length to be 27.5 {\\pm} 1.5 {\\mu}m at 830 nm\n(for a width of 5 {\\mu}m), reducing to 13.4 {\\pm} 1.7 {\\mu}m for a width of 2\n{\\mu}m. For active structures containing low density InGaAs quantum dots at a\nprecisely controlled distance 7-120 nm from the Au-GaAs interface, we probed\nthe mutual coupling between the quantum dot and plasmon mode. These\ninvestigations reveal a unidirectional energy transfer from the propagating\nsurface plasmon to the quantum dot.

The associated electron and\npositron capture rates for these isotopes of iron are also calculated in\nstellar matter. These calculations were recently introduced and this paper is a\nfollow-up which discusses in detail the GT strength distributions and stellar\ncapture rates of key iron isotopes. The calculations are performed within the\nframework of the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation\n(pn-QRPA) theory. The pn-QRPA theory allows a microscopic\n\\textit{state-by-state} calculation of GT strength functions and stellar\ncapture rates which greatly increases the reliability of the results. For the\nfirst time experimental deformation of nuclei are taken into account. In the\ncore of massive stars isotopes of iron, $^{54,55,56}$Fe, are considered to be\nkey players in decreasing the electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{e}$) mainly via\nelectron capture on these nuclide. The structure of the presupernova star is\naltered both by the changes in $Y_{e}$ and the entropy of the core material.\nResults are encouraging and are compared against measurements (where possible)\nand other calculations. The calculated electron capture rates are in overall\ngood agreement with the shell model results. During the presupernova evolution\nof massive stars, from oxygen shell burning stages till around end of\nconvective core silicon burning, the calculated electron capture rates on\n$^{54}$Fe are around three times bigger than the corresponding shell model\nrates.

Critical Power law\ncorrelations between electron wave functions at different energies in the\nvicinity of the AMIT result in the formation of pseudogaps of the local density\nof states. Magnetic impurities can remain unscreened at such sites. We\ndetermine the density of the resulting free magnetic moments in the zero\ntemperature limit. While it is finite on the insulating side of the AMIT, it\nvanishes at the AMIT, and decays with a power law as function of the distance\nto the AMIT. Since the fluctuating spins of these free magnetic moments break\nthe time reversal symmetry of the conduction electrons, we find a shift of the\nAMIT, and the appearance of a semimetal phase. The distribution function of the\nKondo temperature $T_{K}$ is derived at the AMIT, in the metallic phase and in\nthe insulator phase. This allows us to find the quantum phase diagram in an\nexternal magnetic field $B$ and at finite temperature $T$. We calculate the\nresulting magnetic susceptibility, the specific heat, and the spin relaxation\nrate as function of temperature. We find a phase diagram with finite\ntemperature transitions between insulator, critical semimetal, and metal\nphases. These new types of phase transitions are caused by the interplay\nbetween Kondo screening and Anderson localization, with the latter being\nshifted by the appearance of the temperature-dependent spin-flip scattering\nrate.

We consider when the cone of\nmovable curves can be characterized without existence statements of covering\nfamilies by studying the complete intersection cone on a family of blow-ups of\ncomplex projective space, including the moduli space of stable six-pointed\nrational curves, $\\bar{M}_{0,6}$, and the permutohedral or Losev-Manin moduli\nspace of four-pointed rational curves. Our main result is that the movable and\ncomplete intersection cones coincide for the toric members of this family, but\ndiffer for the non-toric member, $\\bar{M}_{0,6}$. The proof is via an algorithm\nthat applies in greater generality. We also give an example of a projective\ntoric threefold for which these two cones differ.\n","330046":"  We extend to any maximally entangled state of a bipartite system whose\nconstituents are arbitrarily (but finite) dimensional the result, recently\nderived for two-dimensional constituents, that hidden variable theories cannot\nhave local parts, i.e., that their local averages cannot differ from the\nquantum mechanical ones.\n","330047":"  We give sufficient and necessary geometric conditions, guaranteeing that an\nimmersed compact closed manifold $\\Sigma^m\\subset \\R^n$ of class $C^1$ and of\narbitrary dimension and codimension (or, more generally, an Ahlfors-regular\ncompact set $\\Sigma$ satisfying a mild general condition relating the size of\nholes in $\\Sigma$ to the flatness of $\\Sigma$ measured in terms of beta\nnumbers) is in fact an embedded manifold of class $C^{1,\\tau}\\cap W^{2,p}$,\nwhere $p>m$ and $\\tau=1-m\/p$. The results are based on a careful analysis of\nMorrey estimates for integral curvature--like energies, with integrands\nexpressed geometrically, in terms of functions that are designed to measure\neither (a) the shape of simplices with vertices on $\\Sigma$ or (b) the size of\nspheres tangent to $\\Sigma$ at one point and passing through another point of\n$\\Sigma$.\n  Appropriately defined \\emph{maximal functions} of such integrands turn out to\nbe of class $L^p(\\Sigma)$ for $p>m$ if and only if the local graph\nrepresentations of $\\Sigma$ have second order derivatives in $L^p$ and $\\Sigma$\nis embedded. There are two ingredients behind this result. One of them is an\nequivalent definition of Sobolev spaces, widely used nowadays in analysis on\nmetric spaces. The second one is a careful analysis of local Reifenberg\nflatness (and of the decay of functions measuring that flatness) for sets with\nfinite curvature energies. In addition, for the geometric curvature energy\ninvolving tangent spheres we provide a nontrivial lower bound that is attained\nif and only if the admissible set $\\Sigma$ is a round sphere.\n","330048":"  An overview is given of the way in which the unification program of particle\nphysics has evolved into the proposal of superstring theory as a prime\ncandidate for unifying quantum gravity with the other forces and particles of\nnature. A key concern with quantum gravity has been the problem of ultraviolet\ndivergences, which is naturally solved in string theory by replacing particles\nwith spatially extended states as the fundamental excitations. String theory\nturns out, however, to contain many more extended-object states than just\nstrings. Combining all this into an integrated picture, called M-theory,\nrequires recognition of the r\\^ole played by a web of nonperturbative duality\nsymmetries suggested by the nonlinear structures of the field-theoretic\nsupergravity limits of string theory.\n","330049":"  Bayesian nonparametric regression with dependent wavelets has dual shrinkage\nproperties: there is shrinkage through a dependent prior put on functional\ndifferences, and shrinkage through the setting of most of the wavelet\ncoefficients to zero through Bayesian variable selection methods. The\nmethodology can deal with unequally spaced data and is efficient because of the\nexistence of fast moves in model space for the MCMC computation. The\nmethodology is illustrated on the problem of modeling the oscillations of\nCepheid variable stars; these are a class of pulsating variable stars with the\nuseful property that their periods of variability are strongly correlated with\ntheir absolute luminosity. Once this relationship has been calibrated,\nknowledge of the period gives knowledge of the luminosity.

After Uchiyama's\nresult, a number of different proofs appeared simplifying the original\narguments, which strongly rely on some known identities for Brownian motion. In\nparticular, Novikov (1996) gives an elementary proof in the case of an\nincreasing boundary. Here, we provide an elementary, half-page proof for the\ncase of a decreasing boundary. Further, we identify that the integral test is\nrelated to a repulsion effect of the three-dimensional Bessel process. Our\nproof gives some hope to be generalized to other processes such as FBM.\n","330051":"  When a magnetic ion vibrates in a metal, it inevitably introduces a new\nchannel of hybridization with conduction electrons and in general, the\nvibrating ion induces electric dipole moment. In such a situation, we find that\nmagnetic and non-magnetic Kondo effects alternatively occur due to the\nscreening of spin moment and electric dipole moment of vibrating ion. In\nparticular, electric dipolar two-channel Kondo effect is found to occur for\nweak Coulomb interaction. We also show that magnetically robust heavy-electron\nstate appears near the fixed point of electric dipolar two-channel Kondo\neffect.

A general mathematical\nmodel based on Markov Chains is derived which makes it possible to predict the\nstability regions of SIC-RA channels, the expected delays in equilibrium and\nthe selection of parameters for a stable channel configuration. Furthermore the\nmodel enables the estimation of the average time before reaching instability.\nThe presented model is verified against simulations and numerical results are\nprovided for comparison of the stability of CRDSA versus the stability of\ntraditional Slotted ALOHA (SA). The presented results show that CRDSA has not\nonly a high gain over SA in terms of throughput but also in its stability.\n","330053":"  Ensuring communications security in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is very\nvital because the security protocols therein, should be devised to work at the\nlink layer. Theoretically, any link layer security protocol must support three\nvital security attributes viz. Confidentiality, Message Integrity and Replay\nprotection. However, in order to ensure lesser overhead, replay protection is\noften not incorporated as part of the link layer security framework. We argue\nhere, that it is essential to implement replay protection at the link layer\nonly and devise a simple scheme to do so. We first survey the common approaches\nto ensuring replay protection in conventional networks. We also implement the\nconventional algorithms for replay protection using the link layer framework\nfor WSNs viz. TinySec as the underlying platform. Subsequently analyzing their\nlimitations, we propose a novel Bloom-filter based replay protection algorithm\nfor unicast communications. We show that our algorithm is better than the other\ncontemporary approaches for ensuring replay protection in unicast\ncommunications in the WSNs.\n","330054":"  We compare a piecewise linear map with constant slope beta>1 and a piecewise\nlinear map with constant slope -beta.

We further show that for for all other values of beta between 1 and 2 the\ntwo maps cannot be isomorphic.\n","330055":"  We prove that Abels' group over an arbitrary nondiscrete locally compact\nfield has a quadratic Dehn function. As applications, we exhibit connected Lie\ngroups and polycyclic groups whose asymptotic cones have uncountable abelian\nfundamental group.

The proliferation of the next generation\nsensor nodes, has not solved this problem, because of the greater emphasis on\nlow-cost deployment. In addition, the WSNs use data-centric multi-hop\ncommunication that in turn, necessitates the security support to be devised at\nthe link layer (increasing the cost of security related operations), instead of\nbeing at the application layer, as in general networks. Therefore, an\nenergy-efficient link layer security framework is necessitated. There do exists\na number of link layer security architectures that offer some combinations of\nthe security attributes desired by different WSN applications. However, as we\nshow in this paper, none of them is responsive to the actual security demands\nof the applications. Therefore, we believe that there is a need for\ninvestigating the feasibility of a configurable software-based link layer\nsecurity architecture wherein an application can be compiled flexibly, with\nrespect to its actual security demands. In this paper, we analyze, propose and\nexperiment with the basic design of such configurable link layer security\narchitecture for WSNs. We also experimentally evaluate various aspects related\nto our scheme viz. configurable block ciphers, configurable block cipher modes\nof operations, configurable MAC sizes and configurable replay protection. The\narchitecture proposed is aimed to offer the optimal level of security at the\nminimal overhead, thus saving the precious resources in the WSNs.\n","330057":"  The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed of resource starved sensor\nnodes that are deployed to sense, process and communicate vital information to\nthe base station. Due to the stringent constraints on the resources in the\nsensor nodes on one hand and due to the communications costs being always\nsignificantly higher than the data processing costs, the WSNs typically, employ\nin-network processing, which aims at reducing effectively, the total number of\npackets eventually transmitted to the base station. Such innetwork processing\nlargely employs data aggregation operations that aggregate the data into a\ncompact representation for further transmission. However, due to the ubiquitous\n& pervasive deployment, heavier resource demands of the security protocols and\ndue to the stringent resource constraints in WSN nodes, the security concerns\nin WSNs are even otherwise critical. These concerns assume alarming proportions\nwhen using data aggregation in which the output of the data aggregator nodes\ndepends on that of various other nodes. Hence, the protocols for data\naggregation have to carefully devised with a constant vigil on ensuring\nsecurity of the data. In this paper, based on our survey of the existing\nresearch efforts for ensuring secure data aggregation, we propose a novel\napproach using homomorphic encryption and additive digital signatures to\nachieve confidentiality, integrity and availability for secure data aggregation\nin wireless sensor networks.\n","330058":"  We report a systematic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study on\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Ru$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ for a wide range of Ru concentrations (0.15\n$\\leq$ \\emph{x} $\\leq$ 0.74). We observed a crossover from two-dimension to\nthree-dimension for some of the hole-like Fermi surfaces with Ru substitution\nand a large reduction in the mass renormalization close to optimal doping.\nThese results suggest that isovalent Ru substitution has remarkable effects on\nthe low-energy electron excitations, which are important for the evolution of\nsuperconductivity and antiferromagnetism in this system.\n","330059":"  This paper is devoted to a comparison of early works of Kato and Yosida on\nthe integration of non-autonomous linear evolution equations $\\dot{x} = A(t)x$\nin Banach space, where the domain $D$ of $A(t)$ is independent of $t$.

Here, we interpret an\n$\\varepsilon$-recurrence network as a discrete subnetwork of a \"continuous\"\ngraph with uncountably many vertices and edges corresponding to the system's\nattractor. This step allows us to show that various statistical measures\ncommonly used in complex network analysis can be seen as discrete estimators of\nnewly defined continuous measures of certain complex geometric properties of\nthe attractor on the scale given by $\\varepsilon$.} In particular, we introduce\nlocal measures such as the $\\varepsilon$-clustering coefficient, mesoscopic\nmeasures such as $\\varepsilon$-motif density, path-based measures such as\n$\\varepsilon$-betweennesses, and global measures such as\n$\\varepsilon$-efficiency. This new analytical basis for the so far\nheuristically motivated network measures also provides an objective criterion\nfor the choice of $\\varepsilon$ via a percolation threshold, and it shows that\nestimation can be improved by so-called node splitting invariant versions of\nthe measures. We finally illustrate the framework for a number of archetypical\nchaotic attractors such as those of the Bernoulli and logistic maps, periodic\nand two-dimensional quasi-periodic motions, and for hyperballs and hypercubes,\nby deriving analytical expressions for the novel measures and comparing them\nwith data from numerical experiments.

To meet the improved capability of hadrontherapy in matching\nthe dose release with the cancer position, new dose monitoring techniques need\nto be developed and introduced into clinical use. The measurement of the fluxes\nof the secondary particles produced by the hadron beam is of fundamental\nimportance in the design of any dose monitoring device and is eagerly needed to\ntune Monte Carlo simulations. We report the measurements done with charged\nsecondary particles produced from the interaction of a 80 MeV\/u fully stripped\ncarbon ion beam at the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Sud, Catania, with a\nPoly-methyl methacrylate target. Charged secondary particles, produced at\n90$\\degree$ with respect to the beam axis, have been tracked with a drift\nchamber, while their energy and time of flight has been measured by means of a\nLYSO scintillator. Secondary protons have been identified exploiting the energy\nand time of flight information, and their emission region has been\nreconstructed backtracking from the drift chamber to the target. Moreover a\nposition scan of the target indicates that the reconstructed emission region\nfollows the movement of the expected Bragg peak position. Exploting the\nreconstruction of the emission region, an accuracy on the Bragg peak\ndetermination in the submillimeter range has been obtained. The measured\ndifferential production rate for protons produced with $E^{\\rm Prod}_{\\rm kin}\n>$ 83 MeV and emitted at 90$\\degree$ with respect to the beam line is: $dN_{\\rm\nP}\/(dN_{\\rm C}d\\Omega)(E^{\\rm Prod}_{\\rm kin} > 83 {\\rm ~MeV},\n\\theta=90\\degree)= (2.69\\pm 0.08_{\\rm stat} \\pm 0.12_{\\rm sys})\\times 10^{-4}\nsr^{-1}$.\n","330062":"  Weak interactions break time-reversal (T) symmetry in the two-state system of\nneutral K mesons.

The pendulum\nmoves with two different oscillation frequencies and two different magnetic\ndampings. Its equation of motion is identical with the differential equation\nfor the real part of the CPT-symmetric K-meson wave function.

We settle the\ncomplexity of the following two problems:\n  1) Given a 2-regular digraph $D$, decide if it contains two arc-disjoint\nbranchings B^+_u, B^-_v.\n  2) Given a 2-regular digraph D, decide if it contains an out-branching B^+_u\nsuch that D remains connected after removing the arcs of B^+_u.\n  Both problems are NP-complete for general digraphs. We prove that the first\nproblem remains NP-complete for 2-regular digraphs, whereas the second problem\nturns out to be polynomial when we do not prescribe the root in advance. We\nalso prove that, for 2-regular digraphs, the latter problem is in fact\nequivalent to deciding if $D$ contains two arc-disjoint out-branchings. We\ngeneralize this result to k-regular digraphs where we want to find a number of\npairwise arc-disjoint spanning trees and out-branchings such that there are k\nin total, again without prescribing any roots.\n","330065":"  We report a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of the\nquasi-one-dimensional quantum magnet CuNCN. Based on magnetization measurements\nabove room temperature as well as muon spin rotation and electron spin\nresonance measurements, we unequivocally establish the localized Cu+2-based\nmagnetism and the magnetic transition around 70 K, both controversially\ndiscussed in the previous literature. Thermodynamic data conform to the\nuniform-spin-chain model with a nearest-neighbor intrachain coupling of about\n2300 K, in remarkable agreement with the microscopic magnetic model based on\ndensity functional theory band-structure calculations. Using exact\ndiagonalization and the coupled-cluster method, we derive a collinear\nantiferromagnetic order with a strongly reduced ordered moment of about 0.4\nmu_B, indicating strong quantum fluctuations inherent to this\nquasi-one-dimensional spin system. We re-analyze the available\nneutron-scattering data, and conclude that they are not sufficient to resolve\nor disprove the magnetic order in CuNCN. By contrast, spectroscopic techniques\nindeed show signatures of long-range magnetic order below 70 K, yet with a\nrather broad distribution of internal field probed by implanted muons.

Moreover, the\npercolation threshold is tunable by an external magnetic field.\n","330067":"  Two main seismic features characterize the Earth's inner core: a North-South\npolar anisotropy and an East-West asymmetry of P-wave velocity and attenuation.\nAnisotropy is expected if shear deformation is induced by convective motions.\nTranslation has recently been put forward as an important mode of convection of\nthe inner core. Combined with a simple diffusive grain growth model, this\nmechanism is able to explain the observed seismic asymmetry, but not the bulk\nanisotropy. The source of anisotropy has therefore to be sought in the shear\nmotions caused by higher modes of convection. Using a hybrid finite-difference\nspherical harmonics Navier-Stokes solver, we investigate the interplay between\ntranslation and convection in a 3D spherical model with permeable boundary\nconditions at the inner core boundary. Three parameters act independently:\nviscosity, internal heating and convection velocity in the outer core. Our\nnumerical simulations show the dominance of pure translation for viscosities of\nthe inner core higher than $10^{20}$ Pas. Translation is almost completely\nhampered by convective motions for viscosities lower than $10^{18}$ Pas.\nBetween these values, translation and convection develop, but convective\ndownwellings are restricted to the coldest hemisphere where crystallization\noccurs. On the opposite side, shear is almost absent, thereby allowing grain\ngrowth. We propose that the coexistence of translation and convection observed\nin our numerical models leads to a seismic asymmetry but localizes deformation\nonly in one hemisphere.\n","330068":"  The intensity noise spectrum of the light passed through an optical\nmicrocavity is calculated with allowance for thermal fluctuations of its\nthickness.

Starting from the\nanalytically known traveling wave solution for the homogeneous medium,\ninfinitely extended, spatially periodic variations in kinetic parameters as the\nexcitation threshold, for example, are taken into account perturbatively. Two\ndifferent multiple scale perturbation methods are applied to derive a\ndifferential equation for the position of the front under perturbations. This\nequation allows the computation of a time independent average velocity,\ndepending on the spatial period length and the amplitude of the\nheterogeneities. The projection method reveals to be applicable in the range of\nintermediate and large period lengths but fails when the spatial period becomes\nsmaller than the front width. Then, a second order averaging method must be\napplied. These analytical results are capable to predict propagation failure,\nvelocity overshoot, and the asymptotic value for the front velocity in the\nlimit of large period lengths in qualitative, often quantitative agreement with\nthe results of numerical simulations of the underlying reaction-diffusion\nequation.

Both systems were previously\nidentified as magnetic white dwarfs from the Zeeman splitting of the Balmer\nabsorption lines in their optical spectra. Their spectral energy distributions\nexhibit a large near-infrared excess, which we interpret as a combination of\ncyclotron emission and possibly a late type companion star. No absorption\nfeatures from the companion are seen in our optical spectra. We derive the\norbital periods from a narrow, variable H_alpha emission line which we show to\noriginate on the companion star.

We\nfind that the bridge adsorption site is energetically favored with respect to\nthe atop site, both at the equilibrium Au-Au spacing of the chain and at larger\nspacings. Instead, a substitutional configuration requires a very elongated\nAu-Au bond, well above the rupture distance of the pristine Au chain. The\nelectronic structure properties can be described by the Blyholder model, which\ninvolves the formation of bonding\/antibonding pairs of 5{\\sigma} and 2{\\pi}*\nstates through the hybridization between molecular levels of CO and metallic\nstates of the chain. In the atop geometry, we find an almost vanishing\nconductance due to the 5{\\sigma} antibonding states giving rise to a Fano-like\ndestructive interference close to the Fermi energy. In the bridge geometry,\ninstead, the same states are shifted to higher energies and the conductance\nreduction with respect to pristine Au chain is much smaller.

We show\nthat only the bridge site can qualitatively account for the evolution of the\nconductance as a function of the contact stretching observed in the\nexperimental conductance traces. The numerical discrepancy between the\ntheoretical and experimental conductance slopes is rationalized through a\nsimple model for the elastic response of the metallic leads.

As opposed to the strategy that handles\nweakly this transmission condition through a Lagrange multiplier, we impose\nhere this restriction exactly in the space of global velocity field. Our\nanalysis of the Galerkin discretization of the resulting problem reveals that,\nif the mixed finite element space used in the Darcy domain admits an\n$\\mathbf{H}(\\text{div})$-stable discrete lifting of the normal trace, then it\ncan be combined with any stable Stokes mixed finite element of the same order\nto deliver a stable global method with quasi-optimal convergence rate.

We test a simple model in which large-scale magnetic field\nvariations are primarily responsible for determining jet properties; however,\nwe find that this model is inconsistent with our best estimates of the relative\nmagnetic field strength in our sample. Models of particle acceleration should\nattempt to account for our results if they are to describe FR-I jets\naccurately.\n","330080":"  The identification of cellular objectives is one of the central topics in the\nresearch of microbial metabolic networks. In particular, the information about\na cellular objective is needed in flux balance analysis which is a commonly\nused constrained-based metabolic network analysis method for the prediction of\ncellular phenotypes. The cellular objective may vary depending on the organism\nand its growth conditions. It is probable that nutritionally scarce conditions\nare very common in the nature and, in order to survive in those conditions,\ncells exhibit various highly efficient nutrient processing systems like\nenzymes. In this study, we explore the efficiency of a metabolic network in\ntransformation of substrates to new biomass, and we introduce a new objective\nfunction simulating growth efficiency.\n  We examined the properties of growth efficiency using a metabolic model for\nEschericia coli. We found that the maximal growth efficiency is obtained at a\nfinite nutrient uptake rate. The rate is substrate-dependent and it typically\ndoes not exceed 20 mmol\/h\/gDW. We further examined whether the maximal growth\nefficiency could serve as a cellular objective function in metabolic network\nanalysis, and found that cellular growth in batch cultivation can be predicted\nreasonably well under this assumption. The fit to experimental data was found\nslightly better than with the commonly used objective function of maximal\ngrowth rate.\n  Based on our results, we suggest that the maximal growth efficiency can be\nconsidered as a plausible optimization criterion in metabolic modeling for E.\ncoli. In the future, it would be interesting to study growth efficiency as a\ncellular objective also in other cellular systems and under different\ncultivation conditions.\n","330081":"  We construct a one parameter family of finite time blow ups to the\nco-rotational wave maps problem from $S^2\\times \\RR$ to $S^2,$ parameterized by\n$\\nu\\in(1\/2,1].$ The longitudinal function $u(t,\\alpha)$ which is the main\nobject of study will be obtained as a perturbation of a rescaled harmonic map\nof rotation index one from $\\RR^2$ to $S^2.$ The domain of this harmonic map is\nidentified with a neighborhood of the north pole in the domain $S^2$ via the\nexponential coordinates $(\\alpha,\\theta).$ In these coordinates\n$u(t,\\alpha)=Q(\\lambda(t)\\alpha)+\\mathcal{R}(t,\\alpha),$ where\n$Q(r)=2\\arctan{r},$ is the standard co-rotational harmonic map to the sphere,\n$\\lambda(t)=t^{-1-\\nu},$ and $\\mathcal{R}(t,\\alpha)$ is the error with local\nenergy going to zero as $t\\rightarrow 0.$ Blow up will occur at\n$(t,\\alpha)=(0,0)$ due to energy concentration, and up to this point the\nsolution will have regularity $H^{1+\\nu-}.$\n","330082":"  We propose a solution to the image deconvolution problem where the\nconvolution kernel or point spread function (PSF) is assumed to be only\npartially known. Small perturbations generated from the model are exploited to\nproduce a few principal components explaining the PSF uncertainty in a high\ndimensional space. Unlike recent developments on blind deconvolution of natural\nimages, we assume the image is sparse in the pixel basis, a natural sparsity\narising in magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM). Our approach adopts a\nBayesian Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling framework. The performance of our\nBayesian semi-blind algorithm for sparse images is superior to previously\nproposed semi-blind algorithms such as the alternating minimization (AM)\nalgorithm and blind algorithms developed for natural images. We illustrate our\nmyopic algorithm on real MRFM tobacco virus data.\n","330083":"  This paper reviews advances in Stein-type shrinkage estimation for\nspherically symmetric distributions. Some emphasis is placed on developing\nintuition as to why shrinkage should work in location problems whether the\nunderlying population is normal or not. Considerable attention is devoted to\ngeneralizing the \"Stein lemma\" which underlies much of the theoretical\ndevelopment of improved minimax estimation for spherically symmetric\ndistributions. A main focus is on distributional robustness results in cases\nwhere a residual vector is available to estimate an unknown scale parameter,\nand, in particular, in finding estimators which are simultaneously generalized\nBayes and minimax over large classes of spherically symmetric distributions.\nSome attention is also given to the problem of estimating a location vector\nrestricted to lie in a polyhedral cone.\n","330084":"  Citation analysis of documents retrieved from the Medline database (at the\nWeb of Knowledge) has been possible only on a case-by-case basis. A technique\nis here developed for citation analysis in batch mode using both Medical\nSubject Headings (MeSH) at the Web of Knowledge and the Science Citation Index\nat the Web of Science. This freeware routine is applied to the case of \"Brugada\nSyndrome,\" a specific disease and field of research (since 1992). The journals\ncontaining these publications, for example, are attributed to Web-of-Science\nCategories other than \"Cardiac and Cardiovascular Systems\"), perhaps because of\nthe possibility of genetic testing for this syndrome in the clinic. With this\nroutine, all the instruments available for citation analysis can now be used on\nthe basis of MeSH terms. Other options for crossing between Medline, WoS, and\nScopus are also reviewed.\n","330085":"  We characterize the value function and the optimal stopping time for a large\nclass of optimal stopping problems where the underlying process to be stopped\nis a fairly general Markov process. The main result is inspired by recent\nfindings for L\\'evy processes obtained essentially via the Wiener-Hopf\nfactorization. The main ingredient in our approach is the representation of the\n$\\beta$-excessive functions as expected suprema. A variety of examples is\ngiven.\n","330086":"  Aims. Red supergiants (RSGs) are among the most luminous of all stars, easily\ndetectable in external galaxies, and may ideally serve as kinematic tracers of\nGalactic structure. Some RSGs are surrounded by circumstellar envelopes\ndetectable by their dust and molecular and, in particular, maser emission. This\nstudy consists of a search for maser emission from silicon monoxide (SiO)\ntoward a significant number of RSGs that are members of massive stellar\nclusters, many of which have only recently been discovered. Further, we aim to\nrelate the occurrence of maser action to properties of the host stars.\n  Methods. Using the IRAM 30 meter telescope, we searched for maser emission in\nthe J = 2 - 1 rotational transition within the first vibrationally excited\nstate of SiO toward a sample of 88 RSGs.\n  Results. With an average rms noise level of 0.25 Jy, we detected maser\nemission in 15% of the sample, toward most of the sources for the first time in\nthis transition. The peak of the emission provides accurate radial velocities\nfor the RSGs. The dependence of the detection rate on infrared colors supports\na radiative pumping mechanism for the SiO masers.\n","330087":"  The electronic structure of potassium intercalated picene and coronene films\nhas been studied using photoemission spectroscopy. Picene has additionally been\nintercalated using sodium. Upon alkali metal addition core level as well as\nvalence band photoemission data signal a filling of previously unoccupied\nstates of the two molecular materials due to charge transfer from potassium. In\ncontrast to the observation of superconductivity in K_xpicene and K_xcoronene\n(x ~ 3), none of the films studied shows emission from the Fermi level, i.e. we\nfind no indication for a metallic ground state. Several reasons for this\nobservation are discussed.\n","330088":"  We use Young's raising operators to derive a Pieri rule for the ring\ngenerated by the indeterminates $h_{r,s}$ given in Macdonald's 9th Variation of\nthe Schur functions. Under an appropriate specialisation of $h_{r,s}$, we\nderive the Pieri rule for the ring $\\La(a)$ of double symmetric functions,\nwhich has a basis consisting of the double Schur functions. Together with a\nsuitable interpretation of the Jacobi--Trudi identity, our Pieri rule allows us\nto obtain a new proof of a rule to calculate the Littlewood--Richardson\npolynomials, which gives a multiplication rule for the double Schur functions.\n","330089":"  The paper is devoted to optimization of resonances for Krein strings with\ntotal mass and statical moment constraints. The problem is to design for a\ngiven $\\alpha \\in \\R$ a string that has a resonance on the line $\\alpha + \\i\n\\R$ with a minimal possible modulus of the imaginary part. We find optimal\nresonances and strings explicitly.\n","330090":"  We study a class of inner functions introduced by Gorkin, Mortini, and\nNikolski, and motivated by Banach algebras and functional calculus\napplications. Answering their question, we produce a singular function that\ncannot be multiplied into this generalized Carleson-Newman class of inner\nfunctions (the class of functions satisfying the so called weak embedding\nproperty). Furthermore, we give elementary proofs for some results on these\nclasses obtained earlier using arguments related to the Gelfand representation\nof $H^\\infty$.\n","330091":"  In this extended abstract we provide a unifying framework that can be used to\ncharacterize and compare the expressive power of query languages for different\ndata base models. The framework is based upon the new idea of valid partition,\nthat is a partition of the elements of a given data base, where each class of\nthe partition is composed by elements that cannot be separated (distinguished)\naccording to some level of information contained in the data base. We describe\ntwo applications of this new framework, first by deriving a new syntactic\ncharacterization of the expressive power of relational algebra which is\nequivalent to the one given by Paredaens, and subsequently by studying the\nexpressive power of a simple graph-based data model.\n","330092":"  Collagen fibres play an important role in the mechanical behaviour of many\nsoft tissues. Modelling of such tissues now often incorporates a collagen fibre\ndistribution. However, the availability of accurate structural data has so far\nlagged behind the progress of anisotropic constitutive modelling. Here, an\nautomated process is developed to identify the orientation of collagen fibres\nusing inexpensive and relatively simple techniques. The method uses established\nhistological techniques and an algorithm implemented in the MATLAB image\nprocessing toolbox. It takes an average of 15 s to evaluate one image, compared\nto several hours if assessed visually. The technique was applied to\nhistological sections of human skin with different Langer line orientations and\na definite correlation between the orientation of Langer lines and the\npreferred orientation of collagen fibres in the dermis was observed. The\nstructural parameters of the Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel (GOH) model were all\nsuccessfully evaluated. It is expected that the results of this study will\nassist those wishing to model skin, and that the algorithm described will be of\nbenefit to those who wish to evaluate the collagen dispersion of other soft\ntissues.\n","330093":"  We study the kinetic and chemical equilibration in \"infinite\" parton matter\nwithin the parton-hadron-string dynamics off-shell transport approach, which is\nbased on a dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) for partons matched to\nreproduce lattice QCD results-including the partonic equation of state-in\nthermodynamic equilibrium. The \"infinite\" parton matter is simulated by a\nsystem of quarks and gluons within a cubic box with periodic boundary\nconditions, at different energy densities, initialized slightly out of kinetic\nand chemical equilibrium. We investigate the approach of the system to\nequilibrium and the time scales for the equilibration of different observables.\nWe, furthermore, study particle distributions in the strongly interacting\nquark-gluon plasma (sQGP) including partonic spectral functions, momentum\ndistributions, abundances of the different parton species and their\nfluctuations (scaled variance, skewness, and kurtosis) in equilibrium. We also\ncompare the results of the microscopic calculations with the ansatz of the\nDQPM. It is found that the results of the transport calculations are in\nequilibrium well matched by the DQPM for quarks and antiquarks, while the gluon\nspectral function shows a slightly different shape due to the explicit\ninteraction of partons. The time scales for the relaxation of fluctuation\nobservables are found to be shorter than those for the average values.\nFurthermore, in the local subsystem, a strong change of the fluctuation\nobservables with the size of the local volume is observed. These fluctuations\nno longer correspond to those of the full system and are reduced to Poissonian\ndistributions when the volume of the local subsystem becomes much smaller than\nthe total volume.\n","330094":"  We consider the effect of the wind and the dissipation on the nonlinear\nstages of the modulational instability. By applying a suitable transformation,\nwe map the forced\/damped Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation into the\nstandard NLS with constant coefficients. The transformation is valid as long as\n|{\\Gamma}t| \\ll 1, with {\\Gamma} the growth\/damping rate of the waves due to\nthe wind\/dissipation. Approximate rogue wave solutions of the equation are\npresented and discussed. The results shed some lights on the effects of wind\nand dissipation on the formation of rogue waves.\n","330095":"  In this paper, we prove some new inequalities of Hadamard-type for s-convex\nfunctions on the co-ordinates.\n","330096":"  Shrinkage estimation has become a basic tool in the analysis of\nhigh-dimensional data. Historically and conceptually a key development toward\nthis was the discovery of the inadmissibility of the usual estimator of a\nmultivariate normal mean. This article develops a geometrical explanation for\nthis inadmissibility. By exploiting the spherical symmetry of the problem it is\npossible to effectively conceptualize the multidimensional setting in a\ntwo-dimensional framework that can be easily plotted and geometrically\nanalyzed. We begin with the heuristic explanation for inadmissibility that was\ngiven by Stein [In Proceedings of the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical\nStatistics and Probability, 1954--1955, Vol. I (1956) 197--206, Univ.\nCalifornia Press]. Some geometric figures are included to make this reasoning\nmore tangible. It is also explained why Stein's argument falls short of\nyielding a proof of inadmissibility, even when the dimension, $p$, is much\nlarger than $p=3$. We then extend the geometric idea to yield increasingly\npersuasive arguments for inadmissibility when $p\\geq3$, albeit at the cost of\nincreased geometric and computational detail.\n","330097":"  Pre-Lie (or Vinberg) algebras arise from flat and torsion-free connections on\ndifferential manifolds. They have been studied extensively in recent years,\nboth from algebraic operadic points of view and through numerous applications\nin numerical analysis, control theory, stochastic differential equations and\nrenormalization. Butcher series are formal power series founded on pre-Lie\nalgebras, used in numerical analysis to study geometric properties of flows on\neuclidean spaces. Motivated by the analysis of flows on manifolds and\nhomogeneous spaces, we investigate algebras arising from flat connections with\nconstant torsion, leading to the definition of post-Lie algebras, a\ngeneralization of pre-Lie algebras. Whereas pre-Lie algebras are intimately\nassociated with euclidean geometry, post-Lie algebras occur naturally in the\ndifferential geometry of homogeneous spaces, and are also closely related to\nCartan's method of moving frames. Lie--Butcher series combine Butcher series\nwith Lie series and are used to analyze flows on manifolds. In this paper we\nshow that Lie--Butcher series are founded on post-Lie algebras. The functorial\nrelations between post-Lie algebras and their enveloping algebras, called\nD-algebras, are explored. Furthermore, we develop new formulas for computations\nin free post-Lie algebras and D-algebras, based on recursions in a magma, and\nwe show that Lie--Butcher series are related to invariants of curves described\nby moving frames.\n","330098":"  In this paper we are interested in the motion of a ball inside a billiard\ntable bounded by a particular smooth curve. This table belongs to a family of\nbilliards which can all be drawn by a common process: the so-called gardener's\nstring construction. The classical elliptical billiard is, of course, the\nforemost member of this family. So it should come as no surprise that our\nhexagonal string billiard shares many basic properties with the latter, but, on\nthe other hand, also exhibits some essential differences with it.\n  We have gathered numerical evidence against the Birkhoff-Poritsky conjecture.\n","330099":"  Forty years ago, Wiesner pointed out that quantum mechanics raises the\nstriking possibility of money that cannot be counterfeited according to the\nlaws of physics. We propose the first quantum money scheme that is (1)\npublic-key, meaning that anyone can verify a banknote as genuine, not only the\nbank that printed it, and (2) cryptographically secure, under a \"classical\"\nhardness assumption that has nothing to do with quantum money. Our scheme is\nbased on hidden subspaces, encoded as the zero-sets of random multivariate\npolynomials. A main technical advance is to show that the \"black-box\" version\nof our scheme, where the polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is\nunconditionally secure. Previously, such a result had only been known relative\nto a quantum oracle (and even there, the proof was never published). Even in\nWiesner's original setting -- quantum money that can only be verified by the\nbank -- we are able to use our techniques to patch a major security hole in\nWiesner's scheme. We give the first private-key quantum money scheme that\nallows unlimited verifications and that remains unconditionally secure, even if\nthe counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank. Our money scheme is\nsimpler than previous public-key quantum money schemes, including a knot-based\nscheme of Farhi et al. The verifier needs to perform only two tests, one in the\nstandard basis and one in the Hadamard basis -- matching the original intuition\nfor quantum money, based on the existence of complementary observables. Our\nsecurity proofs use a new variant of Ambainis's quantum adversary method, and\nseveral other tools that might be of independent interest.\n","330100":"  We study a spin-1\/2 model with triangular XXZ-clusters on the\northogonal-dimer chain in the presence of an external magnetic field. First, we\ndiscuss the case where the triangular clusters are coupled via intermediate\n\"classical\" Ising spins. Diagonalization of the triangular XXZ-clusters yields\nthe exact ground states; finite-temperature properties are computed exactly by\nan additional transfer-matrix step. A detailed analysis reveals a large variety\nof ground states at magnetization M equal to fractions 0, 1\/4, and 1\/2 of the\nsaturation magnetization M=1. Some of these ground states break translational\nsymmetry spontaneously and give rise to doubling of the unit cell. In a second\npart we present complementary numerical data for the spin-1\/2 Heisenberg model\non the orthogonal-dimer chain. We analyze several examples of T=0 magnetization\ncurves, entropy as a function of temperature T and magnetic field, and the\nassociated magnetic cooling rate. Comparison of the two models shows that in\ncertain situations the simplified exactly solvable model yields a qualitatively\nor sometimes even quantitatively accurate description of the more challenging\nquantum model, including a case which may be relevant to experimental\nobservations of an enhanced magnetocaloric effect in the two-dimensional\ncompound SrCu2(BO3)2.\n","330101":"  We demonstrate the suppression of nuclear spin fluctuations in an InAs\nquantum dot and measure the timescales of the spin narrowing effect. By\ninitializing for tens of milliseconds with two continuous wave diode lasers,\nfluctuations of the nuclear spins are suppressed via the hole assisted dynamic\nnuclear polarization feedback mechanism. The fluctuation narrowed state\npersists in the dark (absent light illumination) for well over one second even\nin the presence of a varying electron charge and spin polarization. Enhancement\nof the electron spin coherence time (T2*) is directly measured using coherent\ndark state spectroscopy. By separating the calming of the nuclear spins in time\nfrom the spin qubit operations, this method is much simpler than the spin echo\ncoherence recovery or dynamic decoupling schemes.\n","330102":"  We propose a systematic, model-independent treatment of electric dipole\ntransitions of heavy quarkonium. Within an effective field theory, concretely\npotential non-relativistic QCD, the relativistic corrections of relative order\n$v^2$ to the decay rate are derived. An existing formalism developed for M1\ndecays will be extended for our purpose. We scrutinize and complement former\nresults from potential model calculations.\n","330103":"  We introduce the star cluster evolution code Evolve Me A Cluster of StarS\n(EMACSS), a simple yet physically motivated computational model that describes\nthe evolution of some fundamental properties of star clusters in static tidal\nfields. We base our prescription upon the flow of energy within the cluster,\nwhich is a constant fraction of the total energy per half-mass relaxation time.\nAccording to Henon's predictions, this flow is independent of the precise\nmechanisms for energy production within the core, and therefore does not\nrequire a complete description of the many-body interactions therein. For a\ncluster of equal-mass stars, we thence use dynamical theory and analytic\ndescriptions of escape mechanisms to construct a series of coupled differential\nequations expressing the time evolution of cluster mass and radius. These\nequations are numerically solved using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration\nkernel, and the results benchmarked against a data base of direct N-body\nsimulations. We use simulations containing a modest initial number of stars\n(1024 <= N <= 65 536) and point-mass tidal fields of various strengths. Our\nprescription is publicly available and reproduces the N-body results to within\n~10 per cent accuracy for the entire post-collapse evolution of star clusters.\n","330104":"  In growing numbers, scholars are integrating social media tools like blogs,\nTwitter, and Mendeley into their professional communications. The online,\npublic nature of these tools exposes and reifies scholarly processes once\nhidden and ephemeral. Metrics based on this activities could inform broader,\nfaster measures of impact, complementing traditional citation metrics. This\nstudy explores the properties of these social media-based metrics or\n\"altmetrics\", sampling 24,331 articles published by the Public Library of\nScience.\n  We find that that different indicators vary greatly in activity. Around 5% of\nsampled articles are cited in Wikipedia, while close to 80% have been included\nin at least one Mendeley library. There is, however, an encouraging diversity;\na quarter of articles have nonzero data from five or more different sources.\nCorrelation and factor analysis suggest citation and altmetrics indicators\ntrack related but distinct impacts, with neither able to describe the complete\npicture of scholarly use alone. There are moderate correlations between\nMendeley and Web of Science citation, but many altmetric indicators seem to\nmeasure impact mostly orthogonal to citation. Articles cluster in ways that\nsuggest five different impact \"flavors\", capturing impacts of different types\non different audiences; for instance, some articles may be heavily read and\nsaved by scholars but seldom cited. Together, these findings encourage more\nresearch into altmetrics as complements to traditional citation measures.\n","330105":"  We describe a probabilistic, {\\it sublinear} runtime, measurement-optimal\nsystem for model-based sparse recovery problems through dimensionality\nreducing, {\\em dense} random matrices. Specifically, we obtain a linear sketch\n$u\\in \\R^M$ of a vector $\\bestsignal\\in \\R^N$ in high-dimensions through a\nmatrix $\\Phi \\in \\R^{M\\times N}$ $(M<N)$. We assume this vector can be well\napproximated by $K$ non-zero coefficients (i.e., it is $K$-sparse). In\naddition, the nonzero coefficients of $\\bestsignal$ can obey additional\nstructure constraints such as matroid, totally unimodular, or knapsack\nconstraints, which dub as model-based sparsity. We construct the dense\nmeasurement matrix using a probabilistic method so that it satisfies the\nso-called restricted isometry property in the $\\ell_2$-norm. While recovery\nusing such matrices is measurement-optimal as they require the smallest sketch\nsizes $\\numsam= O(\\sparsity \\log(\\dimension\/\\sparsity))$, the existing\nalgorithms require superlinear runtime $\\Omega(N\\log(N\/K))$ with the exception\nof Porat and Strauss, which requires $O(\\beta^5\\epsilon^{-3}K(N\/K)^{1\/\\beta}),\n~\\beta \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{+}, $ but provides an $\\ell_1\/\\ell_1$ approximation\nguarantee.

Our system applies to \"for all\" sparse signals, is robust against\nbounded perturbations in $u$ as well as perturbations on $\\bestsignal$ itself.\n","330106":"  Defects are believed to play a fundamental role in the supersolid state of\n4He. We report on studies by exact Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations at\nzero temperature of the properties of solid 4He in presence of many vacancies,\nup to 30 in two dimensions (2D). In all studied cases the crystalline order is\nstable at least as long as the concentration of vacancies is below 2.5%. In the\n2D system for a small number, n_v, of vacancies such defects can be identified\nin the crystalline lattice and are strongly correlated with an attractive\ninteraction. On the contrary when n_v~10 vacancies in the relaxed system\ndisappear and in their place one finds dislocations and a revival of the\nBose-Einstein condensation. Thus, should zero-point motion defects be present\nin solid 4He, such defects would be dislocations and not vacancies, at least in\n2D. In order to avoid using periodic boundary conditions we have studied the\nexact ground state of solid 4He confined in a circular region by an external\npotential. We find that defects tend to be localized in an interfacial region\nof width of about 15 A. Our computation allows to put as upper bound limit to\nzero--point defects the concentration 0.003 in the 2D system close to melting\ndensity.\n","330107":"  Let G denote a compact connected Lie group with torsion-free fundamental\ngroup acting on a compact space X such that all the isotropy subgroups are\nconnected subgroups of maximal rank.

Given additional conditions\non the W-action on the fixed-point set $X^T$ we show that the equivariant\nK-theory of X is free over R(G).

Giving up that assumption allows deriving from a\nvariational principle new and better (because logically obtained) field\nequations that more faithfully extend the Poisson equation for Newton's gravity\nthan do Einstein's, with an active gravitational mass density providing the\nsource term. Solving these equations for a nonrotating spherical ball of matter\nwith uniform mass density produces a new, improved interior metric matched at\nthe surface of the ball to Schwarzschild's 'exterior' solution metric. This new\nmetric can then be used to address questions about the flight times of photons\nand neutrinos through such a ball of matter.\n","330110":"  Modern concurrent programming benefits from a large variety of\nsynchronization techniques. These include conventional pessimistic locking, as\nwell as optimistic techniques based on conditional synchronization primitives\nor transactional memory. Yet, it is unclear which of these approaches better\nleverage the concurrency inherent to multi-cores.\n  In this paper, we compare the level of concurrency one can obtain by\nconverting a sequential program into a concurrent one using optimistic or\npessimistic techniques. To establish fair comparison of such implementations,\nwe introduce a new correctness criterion for concurrent programs, defined\nindependently of the synchronization techniques they use.\n  We treat a program's concurrency as its ability to accept a concurrent\nschedule, a metric inspired by the theories of both databases and transactional\nmemory. We show that pessimistic locking can provide strictly higher\nconcurrency than transactions for some applications whereas transactions can\nprovide strictly higher concurrency than pessimistic locks for others. Finally,\nwe show that combining the benefits of the two synchronization techniques can\nprovide strictly more concurrency than any of them individually. We propose a\nlist-based set algorithm that is optimal in the sense that it accepts all\ncorrect concurrent schedules. As we show via experimentation, the optimality in\nterms of concurrency is reflected by scalability gains.\n","330111":"  We discuss the existence of scaling solutions for multicenter black hole\nconfigurations.

These experimental results provide a first evidence of the role\nof thermal fluctuation in XANES at the Al K-edge especially in the pre-edge\nregion. The study is carried out by polarized XANES measurements of single\ncrystals. For any orientation of the sample with respect to the x-ray beam, the\npre-edge peak grows and shifts to lower energy with temperature. In addition\ntemperature induces modifications in the position and intensities of the main\nXANES features. First-principles DFT calculations are performed for both\ncompounds. They show that the pre-edge peak originates from forbidden 1s to 3s\ntransitions induced by vibrations. Three existing theoretical models are used\nto take vibrations into account in the absorption cross section calculations:\ni) an average of the XANES spectra over the thermal displacements of the\nabsorbing atom around its equilibrium position, ii) a method based on the crude\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation where only the initial state is averaged over\nthermal displacements, iii) a convolution of the spectra obtained for the atoms\nat the equilibrium positions with an approximate phonon spectral function. The\ntheoretical spectra so obtained permit to qualitatively understand the origin\nof the spectral modifications induced by temperature. However the correct\ntreatment of thermal fluctuation in XANES spectroscopy requires more\nsophisticated theoretical tools.\n","330115":"  In this work we consider the problem of reconstruction of a signal from the\nmagnitude of its Fourier transform, also known as phase retrieval. The problem\narises in many areas of astronomy, crystallography, optics, and coherent\ndiffraction imaging (CDI). Our main goal is to develop an efficient\nreconstruction method based on continuous optimization techniques. Unlike\ncurrent reconstruction methods, which are based on alternating projections, our\napproach leads to a much faster and more robust method. However, all previous\nattempts to employ continuous optimization methods, such as Newton-type\nalgorithms, to the phase retrieval problem failed. In this work we provide an\nexplanation for this failure, and based on this explanation we devise a\nsufficient condition that allows development of new reconstruction\nmethods---approximately known Fourier phase. We demonstrate that a rough (up to\n$\\pi\/2$ radians) Fourier phase estimate practically guarantees successful\nreconstruction by any reasonable method. We also present a new reconstruction\nmethod whose reconstruction time is orders of magnitude faster than that of the\ncurrent method-of-choice in phase retrieval---Hybrid Input-Output (HIO).\nMoreover, our method is capable of successful reconstruction even in the\nsituations where HIO is known to fail. We also extended our method to other\napplications: Fourier domain holography, and interferometry. Additionally we\ndeveloped a new sparsity-based method for sub-wavelength CDI. Using this method\nwe demonstrated experimental resolution exceeding several times the physical\nlimit imposed by the diffraction light properties (so called diffraction\nlimit).\n","330116":"  We present a novel method for Ankylography: three-dimensional structure\nreconstruction from a single shot diffraction intensity pattern.

We work out analytically all kernel functions\nand unitarity relations required for the lowest partial waves. In order to\nsuppress the dependence on the high-energy regime we also consider once- and\ntwice-subtracted versions of the equations, where we identify the subtraction\nconstants with subthreshold parameters. Assuming Mandelstam analyticity we\ndetermine the maximal range of validity of these equations. As a first step\ntowards the solution of the full system we cast the equations for the\n$\\pi\\pi\\to\\bar NN$ partial waves into the form of a Muskhelishvili-Omn\\`es\nproblem with finite matching point, which we solve numerically in the\nsingle-channel approximation.

If r is a\ndivisor of d, then the Hilbert covariant H_{r,d}(F) vanishes exactly when F is\nthe perfect power of an order r form. In geometric terms, the coefficients of H\ngive defining equations for the image variety X of an embedding P^r->P^d. In\nthis paper we describe a new construction of the Hilbert covariant; and\nsimultaneously situate it into a wider class of covariants called the\nG\\\"ottingen covariants, all of which vanish on X. We prove that the ideal\ngenerated by the coefficients of H defines X as a scheme. Finally, we exhibit a\ngeneralisation of the G\\\"ottingen covariants to n-ary forms using the classical\nClebsch transfer principle.\n","330121":"  We study vortex excitations in one-component Bose-Einstein condensates, with\na special emphasis on the role of anisotropic confinement for the existence,\nstability and dynamical properties of vortices and particularly few-vortex\nclusters. Symmetry breaking features are pervasive within this system even in\nits isotropic installment, where cascades of symmetry breaking bifurcations\ngive rise to the multi-vortex clusters, but also within the anisotropic realm\nwhich naturally breaks the rotational symmetry of the multi-vortex states. Our\nfirst main tool for analyzing the system consists of a weakly nonlinear\n(bifurcation) approach which starts from the linear states of the problem and\nexamines their continuation and bifurcation into novel symmetry-broken\nconfigurations in the nonlinear case. This is first done in the isotropic limit\nand the modifications introduced by the anisotropy are subsequently presented.\nThe second main tool concerns the highly nonlinear regime where the vortices\ncan be considered as individual topologically charged \"particles\" which precess\nwithin the parabolic trap and interact with each other, similarly to fluid\nvortices. The conclusions stemming from both the bifurcation and the\ninteracting particle picture are corroborated by numerical computations which\nare also used to bridge the gap between these two opposite-end regimes.\n","330122":"  A systematic theoretical study of two PbTe-based ternary alloys, Pb1-xCdxTe\nand Pb1-xMnxTe, is reported. First, using ab initio methods we study the\nstability of the crystal structure of CdTe - PbTe solid solutions, to predict\nthe composition for which rock-salt structure of PbTe changes into zinc-blende\nstructure of CdTe. The dependence of the lattice parameter on Cd (Mn) content x\nin the mixed crystals is studied by the same methods. The obtained decrease of\nthe lattice constant with x agrees with what is observed in both alloys. The\nband structures of PbTe-based ternary compounds are calculated within a\ntight-binding approach. To describe correctly the constituent materials new\ntight-binding parameterizations for PbTe and MnTe bulk crystals as well as a\ntight-binding description of rock-salt CdTe are proposed. For both studied\nternary alloys, the calculated band gap in the L point increases with x, in\nqualitative agreement with photoluminescence measurements in the infrared. The\nresults show also that in p-type Pb1-xCdxTe and Pb1-xMnxTe mixed crystals an\nenhancement of thermoelectrical power can be expected.\n","330123":"  This paper proposes a novel joint non-binary network-channel code for the\nTime-Division Decode-and-Forward Multiple Access Relay Channel (TD-DF-MARC),\nwhere the relay linearly combines -- over a non-binary finite field -- the\ncoded sequences from the source nodes. A method based on an EXIT chart analysis\nis derived for selecting the best coefficients of the linear combination.\nMoreover, it is shown that for different setups of the system, different\ncoefficients should be chosen in order to improve the performance. This\nconclusion contrasts with previous works where a random selection was\nconsidered. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms,\nin terms of its gap to the outage probabilities, the previously published joint\nnetwork-channel coding approaches. Besides, this gain is achieved by using very\nshort-length codewords, which makes the scheme particularly attractive for\nlow-latency applications.\n","330124":"  For a quantum many-body system, the direct population of states of\ndouble-excitation character is a clear indication that correlations importantly\ncontribute to its nonequilibrium properties.

As crucial\nbenchmarks, we compute the absorption spectrum of few electrons confined in\nquantum wells of different width.

By means of large scale\nevent-driven Molecular Dynamics simulations, we study systems at different\npacking fractions {\\phi} ranging from weakly supersaturated state points to\nglassy ones, covering different nucleation regimes. We find that such regimes\nalso result in different properties of the crystalline clusters: compact\nclusters are formed in the classical-nucleation-theory regime ({\\phi} \\leq\n0.54), while a crossover to fractal, ramified clusters is encountered upon\nincreasing packing fraction ({\\phi} \\geq 0.56), where nucleation is more\nspinodal-like. We draw an analogy between macroscopic crystallization of our\nclusters and percolation of attractive systems to provide ideas on how the\npacking fraction influences the final structure of the macroscopic crystals. In\nour previous work (Phys. Rev.

For each such flow, we construct a generalized\ncoherent state transform (CST), which is a unitary isomorphism between\n$L^{2}(K)$ and a certain weighted $L^{2}$-space of holomorphic functions. For a\nparticular set of choices, we show that this isomorphism is naturally\ndecomposed as a product of a Heisenberg-type evolution (for complex time\n$-\\tau$) within $L^{2}(K)$, followed by a polarization--changing geometric\nquantization evolution (for complex time $+\\tau$). In this case, our\nconstruction yields the usual generalized Segal--Bargmann transform of Hall. We\nshow that the infinite-dimensional family of Hamiltonian flows can also be\nunderstood in terms of Thiemann's \"complexifier\" method (which generalizes the\nconstruction of adapted complex structures). We will also investigate some\nproperties of the generalized CSTs, and discuss how their existence can be\nunderstood in terms of Mackey's generalization of the Stone-von Neumann\ntheorem.\n","330127":"  For many purposes it is desirable to have an easily understandable and\naccurate picture of the atomic states. This is especially true for the highly\nexcited states which exhibit features not present in the well known states\nhydrogen-like orbitals with usual values of the quantum numbers. It could be\nexpected that such visualizations are readily available. Unfortunately, that is\nnot the case. We illustrate the problems by showing several less fortunate\nearlier presentations in some scientifically most valuable works, and show more\nsuitable visualizations for those cases. The selected cases are not chosen to\ncriticize the authors' approach. Rather, we have taken these very important\npapers to underline the need for serious work with graphical representations\nwhich this work attempts to be a part of.\n  In this text we discuss the problems encountered when visualizing Rydberg\nstates, review some existing presentations and propose guidelines for\napplications. The focus of this work are so called Stark states and coherent\nelliptic states of Rydberg atoms. In the sections on elliptic states we show\nsome quite novel geometric interpretations which should be very helpful in\nanalysis of Rydberg state manipulations in external fields.\n  Our demonstration examples involve only hydrogen-like states.

We calculate the energy enclosed\nby a two-surface of constant radius - in particular, the energy enclosed by the\nevent horizon of the black hole. In this case we find that the magnetic field\nhas the effect of increasing the gravitational energy as compared to the vacuum\nSchwarzschild case.

Thermal entanglement at a certain temperature first increases with the\nincrease of the anisotropy parameter {\\Delta} and then decreases sharply to\nzero when {\\Delta} is close to the isotropic point. We also show how the\nentanglement evolves as the size of the system L becomes large via the RG\nmethod. As L increases, for the spin chain and Koch curve the entanglement\nbetween two terminal spins is fragile and vanishes when L\\geq17, but for two\nkinds of diamond-type hierarchical (DH) lattices the entanglement is rather\nrobust and can exist even when L becomes very large.

Our sample features the characteristic\n\"knee\" in the surface brightness vs. mass distribution at Mstar~3 x 10^10 Msun.\nWe find a clear difference between the age and metallicity distributions of the\nstellar populations above and beyond this knee, which suggests a sudden\ntransition from a constant, highly efficient mode of star formation in\nhigh-mass galaxies, gradually decreasing towards the low-mass end of the\nsample. At fixed mass, our early-type sample is more efficient in building up\nthe stellar content at early times in comparison to the general population of\ngalaxies, with half of the stars already in place by redshift z~2 for all\nmasses.

The field equations are decoupled in the general case, and can be\nsolved exactly for the cases when either the cosmological constant vanishes or\nthe base manifold is Ricci flat. We focus on the case of a negative\ncosmological constant and a Ricci-flat base manifold. The solution has a\ncurvature singularity located at the origin, where also the scalar field\ndiverges. Since there is no event horizon surrounding this singularity, the\nsolution describes a naked singularity dressed with a nontrivial scalar field.\nThis spacetime is an asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter one when the\nRicci-flat base manifold is locally flat.

A k-divisible element is a (non-commutative)\nrandom variable whose n-th moment vanishes whenever n is not a multiple of k.\nFirst, we consider the combinatorial convolution \\ast in the lattices NC of\nnon-crossing partitions and NC^k of k-divisible non-crossing partitions and\nshow that convolving k times with the zeta-function in NC is equivalent to\nconvolving once with the zeta-function in NC^k. Furthermore, when x is\nk-divisible, we derive a formula for the free cumulants of x^k in terms of the\nfree cumulants of x, involving k-divisible non-crossing partitions. Second, we\nprove that if a and s are free and s is k-divisible then sps and a are free,\nwhenever p is any polynomial (on a and s) of degree k - 2 on s. Moreover, we\ndefine a notion of R-diagonal k-tuples and prove similar results. Next, we show\nthat free multiplicative convolution between a measure concentrated in the\npositive real line and a probability measure with k-symmetry is well defined.\nAnalytic tools to calculate this convolution are developed.

The effect of mild squeezing on the coherent light is shown to\nbe striking: the photon number distribution gets localized and it peaks\nmaximally for a particular value of squeezing. The atomic inversion retains its\nstructure for a longer time. The mean linear entropy shows that the atom has a\ntendency to get disentangled from field within the collapse region and also in\nthe revival region, for mild squeezing. These properties are absent for the\ncase of a coherent state or for an excessively squeezed coherent state. We also\nelucidate a connection between these properties and the photon statistics of\nthe mildly squeezed coherent state; these states have the minimum variance and\nare also maximally sub-Poissonian.\n","330152":"  In this note we compute the leading term with respect to the De Concini-Kac\nfiltration of $U_q(\\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ of a generating set for the quantum\nGelfand-Tsetlin subalgebra.\n","330153":"  This is the original paper appeared in the book \"Elliptic and Parabolic\nMethods in Geometry (Minneapolis, MN,1994), A K Peters, Wellesley, MA, (1996)\"\n(p.1-16), except with a few minor modifications as described at the end of the\npaper (on p.14).

We begin with the\nhidden gauge formalism for the interaction of vector mesons, then review\nresults for vector baryon interaction and in particular the resonances which\nappear as composite states, dynamically generated from the interaction of\nvector mesons with baryons. New developments concerning the mixing of these\nstates with pseudoscalars and baryons are also reported. We include some\ndiscussion on the $5\/2^+$ $\\Delta$ resonances around 2000 MeV, where we suggest\nthat the $\\Delta(2000)5\/2^+$ resonance, which comes in the PDG from averaging a\nset of resonances appearing around 1700 MeV and another one around 2200 MeV,\ncorresponds indeed to two distinct resonances. We also report on a hidden charm\nbaryon state around 4400 MeV coming from the interaction of vector mesons and\nbaryons with charm, and how this state has some repercussion in the $J\/\\psi$\nsuppression in nuclei. The interaction of $K^*$ in nuclei is also reported and\nsuggestions are made to measure by means of the transparency ratio the huge\nwidth in the medium that the theoretical calculations predict. The formalism is\nextended to $J\/\\psi$ interaction with nuclei and the transparency ratio for\n$J\/\\psi$ photoproduction in nuclei is studied and shown to be a good tool to\nfind possible baryon states which couple to $J\/\\psi N$.\n","330156":"  The Cosmological General Relativity (CGR) of Carmeli, a 5-dimensional (5-D)\ntheory of time, space and velocity, predicts the existence of an acceleration\na_0 = c \/ tau due to the expansion of the universe, where c is the speed of\nlight in vacuum, tau = 1 \/ h is the Hubble-Carmeli time constant, where h is\nthe Hubble constant at zero distance and no gravity.\n  The Carmeli force on a particle of mass m is F_c = m a_0, a fifth force in\nnature.\n  In CGR, the effective mass density rho_eff = rho - rho_c, where rho is the\nmatter density and rho_c is the critical mass density which we identify with\nthe vacuum mass density rho_vac = -rho_c.\n  The fields resulting from the weak field solution of the Einstein field\nequations in 5-D CGR and the Carmeli force are used to hypothesize the\nproduction of a pair of particles.\n  The mass of each particle is found to be m = tau c^3 \/ 4 G, where G is\nNewton's constant.\n  The vacuum mass density derived from the physics is rho_vac = -rho_c = -3 \/\n(8 pi G tau^2).\n  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) black body radiation at the temperature\nT_o = 2.72548 K which fills that volume is found to have a relationship to the\nionization energy of the Hydrogen atom.

We show results which provide extra\nexperimental evidence on the existence of two $\\Lambda(1405)$ states. We then\nshow the findings of a recent approach to Faddeev equations using chiral\nunitary dynamics, where an explicit cancellation of the two body off shell\namplitude with three body forces stemming from the same chiral Lagrangians\ntakes place. This removal of the unphysical off shell part of the amplitudes is\nmost welcome and renders the approach unambiguous, showing that only on shell\ntwo body amplitudes need to be used.

However, sampling variation in short-read data\nsets and high sequencing error rates of modern sequencers present many new\ncomputational challenges in data interpretation. These challenges have led to\nthe development of new classes of mapping tools and {\\em de novo} assemblers.\nThese algorithms are challenged by the continued improvement in sequencing\nthroughput. We here describe digital normalization, a single-pass computational\nalgorithm that systematizes coverage in shotgun sequencing data sets, thereby\ndecreasing sampling variation, discarding redundant data, and removing the\nmajority of errors. Digital normalization substantially reduces the size of\nshotgun data sets and decreases the memory and time requirements for {\\em de\nnovo} sequence assembly, all without significantly impacting content of the\ngenerated contigs.

The X-ray\nspectrum is consistent with the emission from an absorbed thin thermal plasma\nwith a temperature distribution given by an isobaric cooling flow. The maximum\ntemperature of the cooling flow model is $kT_{max}=43_{-12}^{+23}$ keV. Such a\nhigh temperature can be reached in a shocked region and, given the periodicity\ndetected, most likely arises in a magnetically-channelled accretion flow\ncharacteristic of intermediate polars. The pulsed fraction of the 3.51 h\nmodulation decreases with energy as observed in the X-ray light curves of\nmagnetic CVs, possibly due either to occultation of the accretion column by the\nwhite dwarf body or phase-dependent to absorption.

We distinguish between two cases determined by the cell\ndiffusion term and the space dimension, which are referred as the supercritical\nand subcritical ones. At the first case, the choice of the growth function\nenjoys wide range of possibilities: in particular, it can be zero. Our results\nare new even at the absence of the growth term. At the second case, the\nrestrictions on the growth function are less relaxed: for instance, it cannot\nbe zero but can be Fisher-like. In the case of linear cell diffusion, the\nsolution is regular and unique provided the domain is the whole plane. In\naddition, we study the long-time behaviour of the problem, find dissipative\nestimates, and construct attractors.\n","330166":"  There is an overall perception of increased interdisciplinarity in science,\nbut this is difficult to confirm quantitatively owing to the lack of adequate\nmethods to evaluate subjective phenomena. This is no different from the\ndifficulties in establishing quantitative relationships in human and social\nsciences. In this paper we quantified the interdisciplinarity of scientific\njournals and science fields by using an entropy measurement based on the\ndiversity of the subject categories of journals citing a specific journal. The\nmethodology consisted in building citation networks using the Journal Citation\nReports database, in which the nodes were journals and edges were established\nbased on citations among journals. The overall network for the 11-year period\n(1999-2009) studied was small-world and scale free with regard to the\nin-strength. Upon visualizing the network topology an overall structure of the\nvarious science fields could be inferred, especially their interconnections.

Using optical and\ninfrared catalogs covering between 17 and 68 square degrees of sky, we detect\ncorrelation between the SPT convergence maps and each of the galaxy density\nmaps at >4 sigma, with zero cross-correlation robustly ruled out in all cases.\nThe amplitude and shape of the cross-power spectra are in good agreement with\ntheoretical expectations and the measured galaxy bias is consistent with\nprevious work.

The goal is to determine, with high probability, how many rows are\nrequired so that the sampled matrices have full rank and are well-conditioned\nwith respect to inversion.\n  Extensive numerical experiments illustrate that the three sampling strategies\n(without replacement, with replacement, and Bernoulli sampling) behave almost\nidentically, for small to moderate amounts of sampling. In particular, sampled\nmatrices of full rank tend to have two-norm condition numbers of at most 10.\n  We derive a bound on the condition number of the sampled matrices in terms of\nthe coherence {\\mu} of Q. This bound applies to all three different sampling\nstrategies; it implies a, not necessarily tight, lower bound of O(m {\\mu}\nln(n)) for the number of sampled rows; and it is realistic and informative even\nfor matrices of small dimension and the stringent requirement of a 99 percent\nsuccess probability.\n  For uniform sampling with replacement we derive a potentially tighter\ncondition number bound in terms of the leverage scores of Q. To obtain a more\neasily computable version of this bound, in terms of just the largest leverage\nscores, we first derive a general bound on the two-norm of diagonally scaled\nmatrices.\n  To facilitate the numerical experiments and test the tightness of the bounds,\nwe present algorithms to generate matrices with user-specified coherence and\nleverage scores. These algorithms, the three sampling strategies, and a large\nvariety of condition number bounds are implemented in the Matlab toolbox\nkappa_SQ_v3.\n","330169":"  A random walk (or a Wiener process), possibly with drift, is observed in a\nnoisy or delayed fashion.

When there is a drift, upper and lower bounds on\n\\inf_\\eta \\ex|\\eta-\\tau|^p are established for both types of observations. The\nbounds are tight in the large-level regime for noisy observations and in the\nlarge-level-large-delay regime for delayed observations.

Our approach covers\nchameleon, f(R) gravity, dilaton and symmetron models and allows a unified\ndescription of all these theories. We find that the dynamics of modified\ngravity are entirely captured by the time variation of the scalar field mass\nand its coupling to matter evaluated at the cosmological minimum of its\neffective potential, where the scalar field sits since an epoch prior to Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis. This new parameterisation of modified gravity allows one\nto reconstruct the potential and coupling to matter and therefore to analyse\nthe full dynamics of the models, from the scale dependent growth of structures\nat the linear level to non-linear effects requiring N-body simulations. This\nprocedure is illustrated with explicit examples of reconstruction for\nchameleon, dilaton, f(R) and symmetron models.\n","330172":"  The main background for the supersymmetric stop direct production search\ncomes from Standard Model ttbar events. For the single-lepton search channel,\nwe introduce a few kinematic variables to further suppress this background by\nfocusing on its dileptonic and semileptonic topologies. All are defined to have\nend points in the background, but not signal distributions. They can\nsubstantially improve the stop signal significance and mass reach when combined\nwith traditional kinematic variables such as the total missing transverse\nenergy. Among them, our variable M^W_T2 has the best overall performance\nbecause it uses all available kinematic information, including the on-shell\nmass of both W's. We see 20%-30% improvement on the discovery significance and\nestimate that the 8 TeV LHC run with 20 fb-1 of data would be able to reach an\nexclusion limit of 650-700 GeV for direct stop production, as long as the stop\ndecays dominantly to the top quark and a light stable neutralino. Most of the\nmass range required for the supersymmetric solution of the naturalness problem\nin the standard scenario can be covered.\n","330173":"  Peculiar velocities are an important probe of the growth rate of mass density\nfluctuations in the Universe. Most previous studies have focussed exclusively\non measuring peculiar velocities at intermediate ($0.2 < z < 1$) redshifts\nusing statistical redshift-space distortions. Here we emphasize the power of\npeculiar velocities obtained directly from distance measurements at low\nredshift ($z \\lesssim 0.05$), and show that these data break the usual\ndegeneracies in the \\Omega_{m,0} -- $\\sigma_{8,0}$ parameter space. Using only\npeculiar velocity data, we find $\\Omega_{m,0} = 0.259\\pm0.045$ and\n$\\sigma_{8,0} = 0.748\\pm0.035$. Fixing the amplitude of fluctuations at very\nhigh redshift using observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the\nsame data can be used to constrain the growth index $\\gamma$, with the\nstrongest constraints coming from peculiar velocity measurements in the nearby\nUniverse. We find $\\gamma = 0.619\\pm 0.054$, consistent with LCDM. Current\npeculiar velocity data already strongly constrain modified gravity models, and\nwill be a powerful test as data accumulate.\n","330174":"  Turbulence influences the behavior of many astrophysical systems, frequently\nby providing non-thermal pressure support through random bulk motions. Although\nturbulence is commonly studied in systems with constant volume and mean\ndensity, turbulent astrophysical gases often expand or contract under the\ninfluence of pressure or gravity. Here, we examine the behavior of turbulence\nin contracting volumes using idealized models of compressed gases. Employing\nnumerical simulations and an analytical model, we identify a simple mechanism\nby which the turbulent motions of contracting gases \"adiabatically heat\",\nexperiencing an increase in their random bulk velocities until the largest\neddies in the gas circulate over a \"Hubble\" time of the contraction. Adiabatic\nheating provides a mechanism for sustaining turbulence in gases where no\nlarge-scale driving exists. We describe this mechanism in detail and discuss\nsome potential applications to turbulence in astrophysical settings.\n","330175":"  We study resonating valence bond (RVB) states in the Projected Entangled Pair\nStates (PEPS) formalism. Based on symmetries in the PEPS description, we\nestablish relations between the toric code state, the orthogonal dimer state,\nand the SU(2) singlet RVB state on the kagome lattice: We prove the equivalence\nof toric code and dimer state, and devise an interpolation between the dimer\nstate and the RVB state. This interpolation corresponds to a continuous path in\nHamiltonian space, proving that the RVB state is the four-fold degenerate\nground state of a local Hamiltonian on the (finite) kagome lattice. We\ninvestigate this interpolation using numerical PEPS methods, studying the decay\nof correlation functions, the change of overlap, and the entanglement spectrum,\nnone of which exhibits signs of a phase transition.\n","330176":"  A rapidly growing body of observational results suggests that planet\nformation takes place preferentially at high metallicity. In the core accretion\nmodel of planet formation this is expected because heavy elements are needed to\nform the dust grains which settle into the midplane of the protoplanetary disk\nand coagulate to form the planetesimals from which planetary cores are\nassembled. As well, there is observational evidence that the lifetimes of\ncircumstellar disks are shorter at lower metallicities, likely due to greater\nsusceptibility to photoevaporation. Here we estimate the minimum metallicity\nfor planet formation, by comparing the timescale for dust grain growth and\nsettling to that for disk photoevaporation. For a wide range of circumstellar\ndisk models and dust grain properties, we find that the critical metallicity\nabove which planets can form is a function of the distance r at which the\nplanet orbits its host star. With the iron abundance relative to that of the\nSun [Fe\/H] as a proxy for the metallicity, we estimate a lower limit for the\ncritical abundance for planet formation of [Fe\/H]_crit ~ -1.5 + log(r\/1 AU),\nwhere an astronomical unit (AU) is the distance between the Earth and the Sun.\nThis prediction is in agreement with the available observational data, and\ncarries implications for the properties of the first planets and for the\nemergence of life in the early Universe. In particular, it implies that the\nfirst Earth-like planets likely formed from circumstellar disks with\nmetallicities Z > 0.1 Z_Sun. If planets are found to orbit stars with\nmetallicities below the critical metallicity, this may be a strong challenge to\nthe core accretion model.\n","330177":"  One of the most promising proposals for engineering topological\nsuperconductivity and Majorana fermions employs a spin-orbit coupled nanowire\nsubjected to a magnetic field and proximate to an s-wave superconductor. When\nonly part of the wire's length contacts to the superconductor, the remaining\nconducting portion serves as a natural lead that can be used to probe these\nMajorana modes via tunneling. The enhanced role of interactions in one\ndimension dictates that this configuration should be viewed as a\nsuperconductor-Luttinger liquid junction. We investigate such junctions between\nboth helical and spinful Luttinger liquids, and topological as well as\nnon-topological superconductors. We determine the phase diagram for each case\nand show that universal low-energy transport in these systems is governed by\nfixed points describing either perfect normal reflection or perfect Andreev\nreflection. In addition to capturing (in some instances) the familiar\nMajorana-mediated `zero-bias anomaly' in a new framework, we show that\ninteractions yield dramatic consequences in certain regimes. Indeed, we\nestablish that strong repulsion removes this conductance anomaly altogether\nwhile strong attraction produces dynamically generated effective Majorana modes\neven in a junction with a trivial superconductor. Interactions further lead to\nstriking signatures in the local density of states and the line-shape of the\nconductance peak at finite voltage, and also are essential for establishing\nsmoking-gun transport signatures of Majorana fermions in spinful Luttinger\nliquid junctions.\n","330178":"  The non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated many-body systems\nexhibits some of the most puzzling phenomena and challenging problems in\ncondensed matter physics. Here we report on essentially exact results on the\ntime evolution of an impurity injected at a finite velocity into a\none-dimensional quantum liquid. We provide the first quantitative study of the\nformation of the correlation hole around a particle in a strongly coupled\nmany-body quantum system, and find that the resulting correlated state does not\ncome to a complete stop but reaches a steady state which propagates at a finite\nvelocity. We also uncover a novel physical phenomenon when the impurity is\ninjected at supersonic velocities: the correlation hole undergoes long-lived\ncoherent oscillations around the impurity, an effect we call quantum flutter.\nWe provide a detailed understanding and an intuitive physical picture of these\nintriguing discoveries, and propose an experimental setup where this physics\ncan be realized and probed directly.\n","330179":"  The near-Earth asteroid (NEA) (175706) 1996 FG3 is a particularly interesting\nspacecraft target: a binary asteroid with a low-DeltaV heliocentric orbit. The\norbit of its satellite has provided valuable information about its mass density\nwhile its albedo and colors suggest it is primitive or part of the C-complex\ntaxonomic grouping. We extend the physical characterization of this object with\nnew observations of its emission at mid-Infrared (IR) wavelengths and with\nnear-IR reflection spectroscopy. We derive an area-equivalent system diameter\nof 1.90 \\pm 0.28 km (corresponding to approximate component diameters of 1.83\nkm and 0.51 km, respectively) and a geometric albedo of 0.039 \\pm 0.012.\n  1996 FG3 was previously classified as a C-type asteroid, though the combined\n0.4--2.5 micron spectrum with thermal correction indicates classification as\nB-type; both are consistent with the low measured albedo. Dynamical studies\nshow that 1996 FG3 has most probably originated in the inner main asteroid\nbelt. Recent work has suggested the inner Main Belt (142) Polana family as the\npossible origin of another low-DeltaV B-type NEA, (101955) 1999 RQ36. A similar\norigin for 1996 FG3 would require delivery by the overlapping Jupiter 7:2 and\nMars 5:9 mean motion resonances rather than the nu-6 resonance, and we find\nthis to be a low probability, but possible, origin.\n","330180":"  We show that supersymmetric models with a large Dirac gluino mass can evade\nmuch of the jets plus missing energy searches at LHC. Dirac gaugino masses\narise from \"supersoft\" operators that lead to finite one-loop suppressed\ncontributions to the scalar masses. A little hierarchy between the Dirac gluino\nmass 5 - 10 times heavier than the squark masses is automatic and technically\nnatural, in stark contrast to supersymmetric models with Majorana gaugino\nmasses. At the LHC, colored sparticle production is suppressed not only by the\nabsence of gluino pair (or associated) production, but also because several of\nthe largest squark pair production channels are suppressed or absent. We recast\nthe null results from the present jets plus missing energy searches at LHC for\nsupersymmetry onto a supersoft supersymmetric simplified model (SSSM). Assuming\na massless LSP, we find the strongest bounds are: 748 GeV from a 2j + MET\nsearch at ATLAS (4.7 fb^{-1}), and 684 GeV from a combined jets plus missing\nenergy search using $\\alpha_T$ at CMS (1.1 fb^{-1}). In the absence of a future\nobservation, we estimate the bounds on the squark masses to improve only\nmodestly with increased luminosity. We also briefly consider the further\nweakening in the bounds as the LSP mass is increased.\n","330181":"  We give a linear-time algorithm that checks for isomorphism between two 0-1\nmatrices that obey the circular-ones property.

In this paper, we employ the panoply\nof theoretical and simulation techniques developed for characterizing\nheterogeneous materials to quantify the microstructure and effective diffusive\ntransport properties (diffusion coefficient $D_e$ and mean survival time\n$\\tau$) of collagen type I networks at various collagen concentrations. In\nparticular, we compute the pore-size probability density function $P(\\delta)$\nfor the networks and present a variety of analytical estimates of the effective\ndiffusion coefficient $D_e$ for finite-sized diffusing particles. The\nHashin-Strikman upper bound on the effective diffusion coefficient $D_e$ and\nthe pore-size lower bound on the mean survival time $\\tau$ are used as\nbenchmarks to test our analytical approximations and numerical results.\nMoreover, we generalize the efficient first-passage-time techniques for\nBrownian-motion simulations in suspensions of spheres to the case of fiber\nnetworks and compute the associated effective diffusion coefficient $D_e$ as\nwell as the mean survival time $\\tau$, which is related to nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) relaxation times. Specifically, the Torquato approximation\nprovides the most accurate estimates of $D_e$ for all collagen concentrations\namong all of the analytical approximations we consider. We formulate a\nuniversal curve for $\\tau$ for the networks at different collagen\nconcentrations. We apply rigorous cross-property relations to estimate the\neffective bulk modulus of collagen networks from a knowledge of the effective\ndiffusion coefficient computed here.\n","330183":"  Important information about strong-field atomic or molecular ionization can\nbe missed when using linearly polarized laser fields. The field strength at\nwhich an electron was ionized, or the time during a pulse of the ionization\nevent are examples of such missing information.

Our data\nprovides the first constraints on two proposed relationships between the star\nformation rate of galaxies and the properties of their cluster systems in the\nlow star formation rate regime. The data show broad agreement with these\nrelationships, but significant galaxy-to-galaxy scatter exists. In part, this\nscatter can be accounted for by simulating the small number of clusters\ndetected from stochastically sampling the cluster mass function. However, this\nstochasticity does not fully account for the observed scatter in our data\nsuggesting there may be true variations in the fraction of stars formed in\nclusters in dwarf galaxies.

L. Lapidus and M. van\nFrankenhuijsen [La-vF3] in their reinterpretation of the earlier work of M. L.\nLapidus and H. Maier [LaMa2] on inverse spectral problems and the Riemann\nhypothesis. In essence, it is a map that sends the geometry of a fractal string\nonto its spectrum. In this survey paper, we present the rigorous functional\nanalytic framework given by the authors in [HerLa1] and within which to study\nthe spectral operator. Furthermore, we also give a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the invertibility of the spectral operator (in the critical\nstrip) and therefore obtain a new spectral and operator-theoretic reformulation\nof the Riemann hypothesis. More specifically, we show that the spectral\noperator is invertible (or equivalently, that zero does not belong to its\nspectrum) if and only if the Riemann zeta function zeta(s) does not have any\nzeroes on the vertical line Re(s)=c. Hence, it is not invertible in the\nmid-fractal case when c=1\/2, and it is invertible everywhere else (i.e., for\nall c in(0,1) with c not equal to 1\/2) if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is\ntrue. We also show the existence of four types of (mathematical) phase\ntransitions occurring for the spectral operator at the critical fractal\ndimension c=1\/2 and c=1 concerning the shape of the spectrum, its boundedness,\nits invertibility as well as its quasi-invertibility.\n","330188":"  Protoplanetary discs may become dynamically unstable due to structure induced\nby an embedded giant planet. In this thesis, I discuss the stability of such\nsystems and explore the consequence of instability on planetary migration. I\nbegin with non-self-gravitating, low viscosity discs and show that giant\nplanets induce shocks inside its co-orbital region, leading to a profile\nunstable to vortex formation around a potential vorticity minimum. This\ninstability is commonly known as the vortex or Rossby wave instability.\nVortex-planet interaction lead to episodic phases of migration, which can be\nunderstood in the framework of type III migration. I then examine the effect of\ndisc self-gravity on gap stability. The linear theory of the Rossby wave\ninstability is extended to include disc gravity, which shows that self-gravity\nis effective at stabilising the vortex instability at small azimuthal\nwavenumber. This is consistent with the observation that more vortices develop\nwith increasing disc mass in hydrodynamic simulations. Vortices in\nself-gravitating discs also resist merging, and is most simply understood as\npair-vortices undergoing mutual horsehoe turns upon encounter. I show that in\nsufficiently massive discs vortex modes are suppressed. Instead, global spiral\ninstabilities develop which are associated with a potential vorticity maximum\nat the gap edge. These edge modes can be physically understood as a result of\nunstable interaction between the gap edge and the exterior disc through\ngravity. I show the spiral arms can provide a positive torque on the planet,\nleading to fast migration outwards. I confirm the above results, obtained from\nrazor-thin disc models, persist in three-dimensions.\n","330189":"  In this study, we determine some special Smarandache curves according to\nDarboux frame in E3.

Most of\nthe spectra were obtained with the FAST spectrograph at the FLWO 1.5m telescope\nand reduced in a consistent manner, making data set well suited for studies of\nSN Ia spectroscopic diversity. We study the spectroscopic and photometric\nproperties of SN Ia as a function of spectroscopic class using the\nclassification schemes of Branch et al. and Wang et al. The width-luminosity\nrelation appears to be steeper for SN Ia with broader lines. Based on the\nevolution of the characteristic Si II 6355 line, we propose improved methods\nfor measuring velocity gradients, revealing a larger range than previously\nsuspected, from ~0 to ~400 km\/s\/day considering the instantaneous velocity\ndecline rate at maximum light. We find a weaker and less significant\ncorrelation between Si II velocity and intrinsic B-V color at maximum light\nthan reported by Foley et al., owing to a more comprehensive treatment of\nuncertainties and host galaxy dust. We study the extent of nuclear burning and\nreport new detections of C II 6580 in 23 early-time spectra. The frequency of C\nII detections is not higher in SN Ia with bluer colors or narrower light\ncurves, in conflict with the recent results of Thomas et al.

We base our\ndiscussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in a\nChandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two white\ndwarfs-realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the most\nwidely-discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to SNe Ia. Although\nboth models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early and\nnear-maximum spectra of SN 2011fe obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory\n(SNfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. The level\nof agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum,\nbut a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified.\nObservations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating the\nexplosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leads\nto differences in the 55Co production.

In particular, we compare 802.11 compatible implementations of a\nset of congestion-aware routing protocols against our implementation of state\nof the art shortest path routing protocol (SRCR). We implement congestion-aware\nrouting algorithms Backpressure (BP), Enhanced-Backpressure (E-BP) adapted from\n[1], [2] suitably adjusted for 802.11 implementation. We then propose and\nimplement Congestion Diversity Protocol (CDP) adapted from [3] recognizing the\nlimitations of BP and E-BP for 802.11-based wireless networks. SRCR solely\nutilizes link qualities, while BP relies on queue differential to route\npackets. CDP and E-BP rely on distance metrics which take into account queue\nbacklogs and link qualities in the network. E-BP computes its metric by summing\nthe ETX and queue differential, while CDP determines its metric by calculating\nthe least draining time to the destination.

The flux rope is observed as a hot channel prior\nto and during a solar eruption from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)\ntelescope on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). It initially appears as\na twisted and writhed sigmoidal structure with a temperature as high as 10 MK\nand then transforms toward a semi-circular shape during a slow rise phase,\nwhich is followed by fast acceleration and onset of a flare. The observations\nsuggest that the instability of the magnetic flux rope trigger the eruption,\nthus making a major addition to the traditional magnetic-reconnection paradigm.\n","330219":"  We consider a free action of an Ore semigroup on a higher-rank graph, and the\ninduced action by endomorphisms of the $C^*$-algebra of the graph.

In the reaction 50Ti+249Bk -> (299-x)119 + xn, the maximal\nevaporation residue (ER) cross section is found to be about 0.11 pb for the\n4n-emission channel. For projectile-target combinations producing SHN with\nZ=120, the ER cross section increases with the mass asymmetry in the incident\nchannel increasing. The maximal ER cross sections for 58Fe+244Pu and 54Cr +\n248Cm are relatively small (less than 0.01 pb) and those for 50Ti+249Cf and\n50Ti+251Cf are about 0.05 and 0.25 pb, respectively.\n","330224":"  We study cooperation in multi terminal source coding models involving\nsuccessive refinement. Specifically, we study the case of a single encoder and\ntwo decoders, where the encoder provides a common description to both the\ndecoders and a private description to only one of the decoders.

We characterize the fundamental\nperformance limits in the respective settings of non-causal, strictly-causal\nand causal cribbing. We use a new coding scheme, referred to as Forward\nEncoding and Block Markov Decoding, which is a variant of one recently used by\nCuff and Zhao for coordination via implicit communication.

We employ optimal control\nframework, where boundary heat flux and free boundary are components of the\ncontrol vector, and optimality criteria consists of the minimization of the sum\nof $L_2$-norm declinations from the available measurement of the temperature\nflux on the fixed boundary and available information on the phase transition\ntemperature on the free boundary. This approach allows one to tackle situations\nwhen the phase transition temperature is not known explicitly, and is available\nthrough measurement with possible error. It also allows for the development of\niterative numerical methods of least computational cost due to the fact that\nfor every given control vector, the parabolic PDE is solved in a fixed region\ninstead of full free boundary problem. We prove well-posedness in Sobolev\nspaces framework and convergence of discrete optimal control problems to the\noriginal problem both with respect to cost functional and control.\n","330226":"  In this paper, we study the performance of an amplify-and-forward (AF) based\nanalog network coding (ANC) relay scheme in a multi-hop wireless network under\nindividual power constraints. In the first part, a unicast scenario is\nconsidered. The problem of finding the maximum achievable rate is formulated as\nan optimization problem. Rather than solving this non-concave maximization\nproblem, we derive upper and lower bounds for the optimal rate. A cut-set like\nupper bound is obtained in a closed form for a layered relay network. A\npseudo-optimal AF scheme is developed for a two-hop parallel network, which is\ndifferent from the conventional scheme with all amplification gains chosen as\nthe maximum possible values. The conditions under which either the novel scheme\nor the conventional one achieves a rate within half a bit of the upper bound\nare found. Then we provide an AF-based multi-hop ANC scheme with the two\nschemes for a layered relay network. It is demonstrated that the lower bound of\nthe optimal rate can asymptotically achieve the upper bound when the network is\nin the generalized high-SNR regime. In the second part, the optimal rate region\nfor a two-hop multiple access channel (MAC) via AF relays is investigated. In a\nsimilar manner, we first derive an outer bound for it and then focus on\ndesigning low complexity AF-based ANC schemes for different scenarios. Several\nexamples are given and the numerical results indicate that the achievable rate\nregion of the ANC schemes can perform close to the outer bound.\n","330227":"  We review the method of the calculation of multiloop integrals suggested in\nRef.\\cite{Lee2010}.\n","330228":"  We define the notion of a trace kernel on a manifold M.

In the existing literature, the quantization error is modeled\ntypically as additive noise and the multi-bit and 1-bit quantized CS problems\nare dealt with separately using different treatments and procedures. In this\npaper, a novel variational Bayesian inference based CS algorithm is presented,\nwhich unifies the multi- and 1-bit CS processing and is applicable to various\ncases of noiseless\/noisy environment and unsaturated\/saturated quantizer. By\ndecoupling the quantization error from the measurement noise, the quantization\nerror is modeled as a random variable and estimated jointly with the signal\nbeing recovered. Such a novel characterization of the quantization error\nresults in superior performance of the algorithm which is demonstrated by\nextensive simulations in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for both\nmulti-bit and 1-bit CS problems.\n","330230":"  For a bivariate time series $((X_i,Y_i))_{i=1,...,n}$ we want to detect\nwhether the correlation between $X_i$ and $Y_i$ stays constant for all $i =\n1,...,n$. We propose a nonparametric change-point test statistic based on\nKendall's tau and derive its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis\nof no change by means a new U-statistic invariance principle for dependent\nprocesses. The asymptotic distribution depends on the long run variance of\nKendall's tau, for which we propose an estimator and show its consistency.\nFurthermore, assuming a single change-point, we show that the location of the\nchange-point is consistently estimated. Kendall's tau possesses a high\nefficiency at the normal distribution, as compared to the normal maximum\nlikelihood estimator, Pearson's moment correlation coefficient. Contrary to\nPearson's correlation coefficient, it has excellent robustness properties and\nshows no loss in efficiency at heavy-tailed distributions. We assume the data\n$((X_i,Y_i))_{i=1,...,n}$ to be stationary and P-near epoch dependent on an\nabsolutely regular process. The P-near epoch dependence condition constitutes a\ngeneralization of the usually considered $L_p$-near epoch dependence, $p \\ge\n1$, that does not require the existence of any moments. It is therefore very\nwell suited for our objective to efficiently detect changes in correlation for\narbitrarily heavy-tailed data.\n","330231":"  Thin and large area NaI(Tl) scintillator to search for WIMPs dark matter was\ndeveloped.

While most previous approaches\nhave focused on completely encrypting the video stream, we introduce a spatial\nencryption scheme by blurring the image\/video contents to create a CBP. Our\ngoal is to obscure detail in public video streams by blurring while allowing\nbehavior to be recognized and to quickly deblur the stream so that details are\navailable if behavior is recognized as suspicious. We create a CBP by blurring\nthe same latent image with two unknown kernels. The two kernels are coprime\nwhen mapped to bivariate polynomials in the z domain. To deblur the CBP we\nfirst use the coprime constraint to approximate the kernels and sample the\nbivariate CBP polynomials in one dimension on the unit circle. At each sample\npoint, we factor the 1D polynomial pair and compose the results into a 2D\nkernel matrix. Finally, we compute the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of\nthe kernel matrices to recover the coprime kernels and then the latent video\nstream. It is therefore only possible to deblur the video stream if a user has\naccess to both streams. To improve the practicability of our algorithm, we\nimplement our algorithm using a graphics processing unit (GPU) to decrypt the\nblurred video streams in real-time, and extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our new scheme can effectively protect sensitive identity\ninformation in surveillance videos and faithfully reconstruct the unblurred\nvideo stream when two blurred sequences are available.\n","330234":"  Spatial evolution game has traditionally assumed that players interact with\nneighbors on a single network, which is isolated and not influenced by other\nsystems.

The data are needed for non-LTE\napplications in cool astrophysical environments, especially cool stellar\natmospheres, and are presented for a temperature range of 500-8000 K. From\nconsideration of the sensitivity of the cross-sections to various uncertainties\nin the calculations, most importantly input quantum chemical data and the\nnumerical accuracy of the scattering calculations, a measure of the possible\nuncertainties in the rate coefficients is estimated.\n","330237":"  This paper shows that phase space methods using a positive P type\ndistribution function involving both c-number variables (for the cavity mode)\nand Grassmann variables (for the two level atom) can be used to treat the\nJaynes-Cummings model. Although it is a Grassmann function, the distribution\nfunction is equivalent to six c-number functions of the two bosonic variables.\nExperimental quantities are given as bosonic phase space integrals involving\nthe six functions. A Fokker-Planck equation involving both left and right\nGrassmann differentiation can be obtained for the distribution function, and is\nequivalent to six coupled equations for the six c-number functions.\n  The approach used involves choosing the canonical form of the (non-unique)\npositive P distribution function, where the correspondence rules for bosonic\noperators are non-standard and hence the Fokker-Planck equation is also\nunusual. Initial conditions, such as for initially uncorrelated states, are\nused to determine the initial distribution function. Transformations to new\nbosonic variables rotating at the cavity frequency enables the six coupled\nequations for the new c-number functions (also equivalent to the canonical\nGrassmann distribution function) to be solved analytically, based on an ansatz\nfrom a 1980 paper by Stenholm. It is then shown that the distribution function\nis the same as that determined from the well-known solution based on coupled\nequations for state vector amplitudes of atomic and n-photon product states.\n  The treatment of the simple two fermion mode Jaynes-Cummings model is a\nuseful test case for the future development of phase space Grassmann\ndistribution functional methods for multi-mode fermionic applications in\nquantum-atom optics.\n","330238":"  The experience of discovery of the radioactive products which have released\ninto atmosphere of Sakhalin region from Fukushima Daiichi accident is\npresented.

The quantum diffusion of massive Dirac fermions can be viewed as a\nsinglet Cooperon in the massless limit and a triplet Cooperon in the large-mass\nlimit. The spin-orbit scattering behaves like random magnetic fields only to\nthe triplet Cooperon, and suppresses the weak localization of Dirac fermions in\nthe large-mass regime. This behavior suggests an experiment to detect the weak\nlocalization of bulk subbands in topological insulator thin films, in which a\nnarrowing of the cusp of the negative magnetoconductivity is expected after\ndoping heavy-element impurities.

The replica method, developed\nin statistical physics, is used to analyze the energy penalties for the two\nUS-VP schemes in the large-system limit, where the number of users, the number\nof selected users, and the number of transmit antennas tend to infinity with\ntheir ratios kept constant. Four observations are obtained in the large-system\nlimit: First, the assumptions of replica symmetry (RS) and 1-step replica\nsymmetry breaking (1RSB) for DD-US can provide acceptable approximations for\nlow and moderate system loads, respectively. Secondly, DD-US outperforms CVP\nwith random US in terms of the energy penalty for low-to-moderate system loads.\nThirdly, the asymptotic energy penalty of DD-US is indistinguishable from that\nof US-CVP for low system loads.

Since there is no scale in the\ngeometry itself apart from the horizon size, there is no Hawking-Page\ntransition. As a consequence, the D7 brane embedding can encode the effect of\nthe the finite temperature as well as finite baryon density even for low\ntemperature. The probe D-brane embedding, however, undergoes a chiral phase\ntransition according to the temperature and density parameter.\n  We studied such phase transitions and calculated the constituent quark mass,\nchiral condensation and the binding energy of baryons as function of the\ndensity.

We predict the second 0+\nstate with the excitation energy of 5.6 MeV, which corresponds to the $2p2h$\nstate from the ground state. We evaluate the occupation numbers of four\nvalence-protons in the 8C states and also the J^\\pi distribution of proton-pair\nnumbers of the two 0+ states of 8C. The ground state involves a large amount of\nthe 2+ proton-pair fraction, while the excited 0+_2 state almost consists of\ntwo of the 0+ proton pairs, which can be understood from the\n(p_{3\/2})^2(p_{1\/2})^2 configuration.

We prove that it is not possible for the\nprover to improve on the optimum average value per repetition by repeating the\nprotocol multiple times in parallel.\n  We look then at games in which the outcomes are classified into two types,\nwinning outcomes and losing outcomes. We ask what is the optimal probability\nfor the prover of winning at least k times out of n parallel repetitions, given\nthat the optimal probability of winning when only one repetition is considered\nis $p$. A reasonable conjecture for the answer would be \\sum_{m \\geq k} {n\n\\choose m} p^m (1-p)^{n-m}, as that is the answer when it is optimal for the\nprover to act independently. This is known to be the correct answer when k=n,\nand also in the classical case. It is also correct in some generalizations of\nthe classical case that we will discuss later. We will show how this cannot be\nextended to all cases, presenting an example of an interaction with k=1,n=2 in\nwhich p\\approx 0.85, but it is possible to always win at least once. We will\nthen give some upper bounds on the optimal probability for the prover of\nwinning k times out of n parallel repetitions.

We have determined the actual\nchemical formula as YMn2+dZn20-x-dMx, with M = In or Al, and have identified\nthe characteristic preferences with which the incorporated M and excess Mn\natoms occupy the three crystallographic sites for Zn atoms. The Mn atoms in the\npyrochlore lattice possess small magnetic moments that interact with each other\nantiferromagnetically but exhibit no long-range order above 0.4 K, probably\nowing to the geometrical frustration of the pyrochlore lattice. As a result,\nthe effective mass of the conduction electrons is considerably enhanced, as\nobserved in the related pyrochlore-lattice compounds (Y,Sc)Mn2 and LiV2O4.\nHowever, the presence of excess Mn atoms with large localized magnetic moments\ncomparable to spin 5\/2 tends to mask the inherent magnetism of the pyrochlore\nMn atoms.

In order to make a direct connection with realistic\nexperiments, we next take into account a parabolic trapping potential and\ncompute the real-time dynamics of dipole oscillations induced by suddenly\ndisplacing the trap center. We consider the following two cases: standard\nsoftcore bosons, whose interparticle interactions include the on-site one only,\nand hardcore bosons with long-range dipole-dipole interactions. For both cases,\nwe show that the dipole oscillation is significantly damped when the maximum\nlocal momentum exceeds a certain threshold, which quantitatively agrees with\nthe critical momentum for the dynamical instability in the homogeneous system.\nIn the case of dipolar hardcore bosons, the dynamical instability of dipole\noscillations leads to the formation of checkerboard density waves in the\nsuperfluid phase near the boundary to the supersolid phase.\n","330250":"  Due to inter-subunit communication, multisubunit enzymes usually hydrolyze\nATP in a concerted fashion.

In this scenario, before the rip singularity is arrived, the universe is\nin an inflationary regime. We numerically calculate the spectrum of primordial\nperturbation generated during this period and find that the results may be\nconsistent with observations. This implies that if the reheating happens again,\nthe current acceleration might be just a start of phantom inflation responsible\nfor the upcoming observational universe.\n","330261":"  Shimura reciprocity law allows us to verify that a modular function is a\nclass invariant.

They are used for\ndetection and localization of change for the purpose of anomaly detection,\nmonitoring, or planning. Distance queries are particularly useful when data\nsets such as measurements, snapshots of a system, content, traffic matrices,\nand activity logs are collected repeatedly.\n  Random sampling, which can be efficiently performed over streamed or\ndistributed data, is an important tool for scalable data analysis. The sample\nconstitutes an extremely flexible summary, which naturally supports domain\nqueries and scalable estimation of statistics, which can be specified after the\nsample is generated. The effectiveness of a sample as a summary, however,\nhinges on the estimators we have.\n  We derive novel estimators for estimating $L_p$ distance from sampled data.\nOur estimators apply with the most common weighted sampling schemes: Poisson\nProbability Proportional to Size (PPS) and its fixed sample size variants. They\nalso apply when the samples of different data sets are independent or\ncoordinated. Our estimators are admissible (Pareto optimal in terms of\nvariance) and have compelling properties.\n  We study the performance of our Manhattan and Euclidean distance ($p=1,2$)\nestimators on diverse datasets, demonstrating scalability and accuracy even\nwhen a small fraction of the data is sampled.

By fitting the\ncurrent observational data to constrain the interacting models, it is found\nthat the interacting strength is non-vanishing, but weak for the case of\nconstant interaction function, and the interaction is not obvious for the case\nof variable interaction function. In addition, for seeing the influence from\ninteraction we also investigate the evolutions of interaction function,\neffective state parameter for dark energy and energy density of dark matter. At\nlast some geometrical quantities in the interacting scenarios are discussed.\n","330265":"  Time variable cosmological constant (TVCC) of holographic origin with\ninteraction in Brans-Dicke theory is discussed in this paper. We investigate\nsome characters for this model, and show the evolutions of deceleration\nparameter and equation of state (EOS) for dark energy. It is shown that in this\nscenario an accelerating universe can be obtained and the evolution of EOS for\ndark energy can cross over the boundary of phantom divide. In addition, a\ngeometrical diagnostic method, jerk parameter is applied to this model to\ndistinguish it with cosmological constant.\n","330266":"  We use the Markov ChainMonte Carlo method to investigate global constraints\non the generalized holographic (GH) dark energy with flat and non-flat universe\nfrom the current observed data: the Union2 dataset of type supernovae Ia\n(SNIa), high-redshift Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), the observational Hubble data\n(OHD), the cluster X-ray gas mass fraction, the baryon acoustic oscillation\n(BAO), and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data.

This attractive notion has been demonstrated in\njust a few cases. We demonstrate how holography - a mapping between the quantum\ncritical system and a gravity dual - provides an illuminating perspective and\nnew results. Non-trivial out-of-equilibrium universality is particularly\napparent in current noise, which is dual to Hawking radiation in the\ngravitational system. We calculate this in a 2-dimensional system driven by a\nstrong in-plane electric field and deduce a universal scaling function\ninterpolating between previously established equilibrium and\nfar-from-equilibrium current noise. Since this applies at all fields,\nout-of-equilibrium experiments no longer require very high fields for\ncomparison with theory.\n","330268":"  We derive a tight bound between the quality of estimating a quantum state by\nmeasurement and the success probability of undoing the measurement in arbitrary\ndimensional systems, which completely describes the tradeoff relation between\nthe information gain and reversibility. In this formulation, it is clearly\nshown that the information extracted from a weak measurement is erased through\nthe reversing process. Our result broadens the information-theoretic\nperspective on quantum measurement as well as provides a standard tool to\ncharacterize weak measurements and reversals.\n","330269":"  We introduce Monte Carlo methods to compute the solution of elliptic\nequations with pure Neumann boundary conditions. We first prove that the\nsolution obtained by the stochastic representation has a zero mean value with\nrespect to the invariant measure of the stochastic process associated to the\nequation. Pointwise approximations are computed by means of standard and new\nsimulation schemes especially devised for local time approximation on the\nboundary of the domain. Global approximations are computed thanks to a\nstochastic spectral formulation taking into account the property of zero mean\nvalue of the solution. This stochastic formulation is asymptotically perfect in\nterms of conditioning. Numerical examples are given on the Laplace operator on\na square domain with both pure Neumann and mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary\nconditions.

This article discusses minimaxity\nand adaptive minimaxity in nonparametric function estimation. Three\ninterrelated problems, function estimation under global integrated squared\nerror, estimation under pointwise squared error, and nonparametric confidence\nintervals, are considered. Shrinkage is pivotal in the development of both the\nminimax theory and the adaptation theory. While the three problems are closely\nconnected and the minimax theories bear some similarities, the adaptation\ntheories are strikingly different. For example, in a sharp contrast to adaptive\npoint estimation, in many common settings there do not exist nonparametric\nconfidence intervals that adapt to the unknown smoothness of the underlying\nfunction. A concise account of these theories is given. The connections as well\nas differences among these problems are discussed and illustrated through\nexamples.\n","330271":"  This paper is a survey of two kinds of \"compressed\" proof schemes, the\n\\emph{matrix method} and \\emph{proof nets}, as applied to a variety of logics\nranging along the substructural hierarchy from classical all the way down to\nthe nonassociative Lambek system. A novel treatment of proof nets for the\nlatter is provided. Descriptions of proof nets and matrices are given in a\nuniform notation based on sequents, so that the properties of the schemes for\nthe various logics can be easily compared.\n","330272":"  In cognitive radio networks, channel aggregation (CA) and channel\nfragmentation (CF) techniques have been proposed to enhance the spectrum\nutilization. While most of the literature studies CA and CF independently, in\nthis paper we combine CA and CF innovatively and present a new spectrum sharing\nstrategy named CAF (Channel Aggregation and Fragmentation). We elaborate on the\nproposed CAF strategy and derive the balance equation by a continuous time\nMarkov chain (CTMC) model. Then various system performance metrics including\nblocking probability, dropping probability, spectrum utilization and throughput\nof the secondary network are evaluated. Both analytical and simulation results\nshow that our strategy lowers the blocking and dropping probabilities and\nenhances the spectrum utilization and throughput effectively. Moreover, by\ntuning the bandwidth requirement of each secondary user, different system\nperformance can be achieved.\n","330273":"  In this paper, we introduce a new algebraic type of `convexoid rings', and we\ngive the definition of (weak) convexoid schemes, which share similar properties\nwith ordinary schemes.

The adaptation of Katetov's technique uses a\ngeneralisation of the Arens-Eells enveloping space to metric space with a\ndistinguished normed subspace. This allows us to give a positive answer to a\nquestion of Uspenskij, whether the linear isometry group of the Gurarij space\nis a universal Polish group.\n","330275":"  We investigate the stability of synchronized states in delay-coupled networks\nwhere synchronization takes place in groups of different local dynamics or in\ncluster states in networks with identical local dynamics. Using a master\nstability approach, we find that the master stability function shows a discrete\nrotational symmetry depending on the number of groups. The coupling matrices\nthat permit solutions on group or cluster synchronization manifolds show a very\nsimilar symmetry in their eigenvalue spectrum, which helps to simplify the\nevaluation of the master stability function. Our theory allows for the\ncharacterization of stability of different patterns of synchronized dynamics in\nnetworks with multiple delay times, multiple coupling functions, but also with\nmultiple kinds of local dynamics in the networks' nodes. We illustrate our\nresults by calculating stability in the example of delay-coupled semiconductor\nlasers and in a model for neuronal spiking dynamics.\n","330276":"  This paper introduces and analyzes a particular class of Polya urns: balls\nare of two colors, can only be added (the urns are said to be additive) and at\nevery step the same constant number of balls is added, thus only the color\ncompositions varies (the urns are said to be balanced). These properties make\nthis class of urns ideally suited for analysis from an \"analytic combinatorics\"\npoint-of-view, following in the footsteps of Flajolet-Dumas-Puyhaubert, 2006.\nThrough an algebraic generating function to which we apply a multiple\ncoalescing saddle-point method, we are able to give precise asymptotic results\nfor the probability distribution of the composition of the urn, as well as\nlocal limit law and large deviation bounds.\n","330277":"  We obtain two-sided bounds for the density of stochastic processes satisfying\na weak H\\\"ormander condition. In particular we consider the cases when the\nsupport of the density is not the whole space and when the density has various\nasymptotic regimes depending on the starting\/final points considered (which are\nas well related to the number of brackets needed to span the space in\nH\\\"ormander's theorem). The proofs of our lower bounds are based on Harnack\ninequalities for positive solutions of PDEs whereas the upper bounds derive\nfrom the probabilistic representation of the density given by the Malliavin\ncalculus.\n","330278":"  Number systems with a rational number $a\/b > 1$ as base have gained interest\nin recent years. In particular, relations to Mahler's 3\/2-problem as well as\nthe Josephus problem have been established. In the present paper we show that\nthe patterns of digits in the representations of positive integers in such a\nnumber system are uniformly distributed. We study the sum-of-digits function of\nnumber systems with rational base $a\/b$ and use representations w.r.t. this\nbase to construct normal numbers in base $a$ in the spirit of Champernowne. The\nmain challenge in our proofs comes from the fact that the language of the\nrepresentations of integers in these number systems is not context-free. The\nintricacy of this language makes it impossible to prove our results along\nclassical lines. In particular, we use self-affine tiles that are defined in\ncertain subrings of the ad\\'ele ring $\\mathbb{A}_\\mathbb{Q}$ and Fourier\nanalysis in $\\mathbb{A}_\\mathbb{Q}$. With help of these tools we are able to\nreformulate our results as estimation problems for character sums.\n","330279":"  The Work Function Algorithm is the most effective deterministic on-line\nalgorithm for the k-server problem. Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou proved WFA is\n(2k-1) competitive. However the best known implementation of WFA requires time\nO(i^2) to process request r_i and this makes WFA impractical for long sequences\nof requests. The O(i^2) time is spent to compute the work function on the whole\nhistory of past requests. In order to make constant the time to process a\nrequest, Rudec and Menger proposed to restrict the history to a moving window\nof fixed size. However WFA restricted to a moving window loses its\ncompetitiveness. Here we give a condition that allows WFA to forget the whole\nprevious history and restart from scratch without losing competitiveness.\nMoreover for most of the metric spaces of practical interest (finite or bounded\nspaces) there is a constant bound on the length of the history before the\ncondition is verified and this makes O(1) the time to process each request.\n","330280":"  The understanding of electrokinetics for unsaturated conditions is crucial\nfor numerous of geophysical data interpretation. Nevertheless, the behaviour of\nthe streaming potential coefficient C as a function of the water saturation Sw\nis still discussed. We propose here to model both the Richards' equation for\nhydrodynamics and the Poisson's equation for electrical potential for\nunsaturated conditions using 1-D finite element method. The equations are first\npresented and the numerical scheme is then detailed for the Poisson's equation.\nThen, computed streaming potentials (SPs) are compared to recently published SP\nmeasurements carried out during drainage experiment in a sand column. We show\nthat the apparent measurement of DV \/ DP for the dipoles can provide the SP\ncoefficient in these conditions. Two tests have been performed using existing\nmodels for the SP coefficient and a third one using a new relation. The results\nshow that existing models of unsaturated SP coefficients C(Sw) provide poor\nresults in terms of SP magnitude and behaviour. We demonstrate that the\nunsaturated SP coefficient can be until one order of magnitude larger than\nCsat, its value at saturation. We finally prove that the SP coefficient follows\na non-monotonous behaviour with respect to water saturation.

Although the hydrodynamic stability of\ndisk-like flows has been tested in experiments, results are contradictory and\nsuggest either laminar or turbulent flow. Direct numerical simulations reported\nhere show that currently investigated laboratory flows are hydrodynamically\nunstable and become turbulent at low Reynolds numbers. The underlying\ninstabilities stem from the axial boundary conditions, affect the flow globally\nand enhance angular-momentum transport.\n","330283":"  This letter introduces a novel channel coding design framework for\nshort-length codewords that permits balancing the tradeoff between the bit\nerror rate floor and waterfall region by modifying a single real-valued\nparameter. The proposed approach is based on combining convolutional coding\nwith a $q$-ary linear combination and unequal energy allocation, the latter\nbeing controlled by the aforementioned parameter. EXIT charts are used to shed\nlight on the convergence characteristics of the associated iterative decoder,\nwhich is described in terms of factor graphs. Simulation results show that the\nproposed scheme is able to adjust its end-to-end error rate performance\nefficiently and easily, on the contrary to previous approaches that require a\nfull code redesign when the error rate requirements of the application change.\nSimulations also show that, at mid-range bit-error rates, there is a small\nperformance penalty with respect to the previous approaches. However, the EXIT\nchart analysis and the simulation results suggest that for very low bit-error\nrates the proposed system will exhibit lower error floors than previous\napproaches.\n","330284":"  Without the faithful assumption, we prove that every Jordan derivation on a\nclass of path algebras of quivers without oriented cycles is a derivation and\nthat every Lie derivation on such kinds of algebras is of the standard form.\n","330285":"  We prove the following criterion for the pro-representability of the\ndeformation cohomology of a commutative formal Lie group.

For a commutative formal Lie group E, we have the\ndeformation cohomology of f with coefficients in E at our disposal. If the\nhigher direct images of the tangent space of E are locally free and of finite\nrank then the deformation cohomology is pro-representable by a commutative\nformal Lie group.\n","330286":"  Theorems about characterization of finite rank Toeplitz operators in\nFock-Segal-Bargmann spaces, known previously only for symbols with compact\nsupport, are carried over to symbols without that restriction, however with a\nrather rapid decay at infinity.

This paper deals with variable\nselection methodology in the case of high-dimensional problems where the\nresponse variable can be right censored. We focuse on new stable variable\nselection methods based on bootstrap for two methodologies: the Cox\nproportional hazard model and survival trees. As far as the Cox model is\nconcerned, we investigate the bootstrapping applied to two variable selection\ntechniques: the stepwise algorithm based on the AIC criterion and the\nL1-penalization of Lasso. Regarding survival trees, we review two\nmethodologies: the bootstrap node-level stabilization and random survival\nforests. We apply these different approaches to two real data sets. We compare\nthe methods on the prediction error rate based on the Harrell concordance index\nand the relevance of the interpretation of the corresponding selected models.\nThe aim is to find a compromise between a good prediction performance and ease\nto interpretation for clinicians. Results suggest that in the case of a small\nnumber of individuals, a bootstrapping adapted to L1-penalization in the Cox\nmodel or a bootstrap node-level stabilization in survival trees give a good\nalternative to the random survival forest methodology, known to give the\nsmallest prediction error rate but difficult to interprete by\nnon-statisticians. In a clinical perspective, the complementarity between the\nmethods based on the Cox model and those based on survival trees would permit\nto built reliable models easy to interprete by the clinician.\n","330288":"  The physics of a quantum dot with electron-electron interactions is well\ncaptured by the so called \"Universal Hamiltonian\" if the dimensionless\nconductance of the dot is much higher than unity. Within this scheme\ninteractions are represented by three spatially independent terms which\ndescribe the charging energy, the spin-exchange and the interaction in the\nCooper channel. In this paper we concentrate on the exchange interaction and\ngeneralize the functional bosonization formalism developed earlier for the\ncharging energy. This turned out to be challenging as the effective bosonic\naction is formulated in terms of a vector field and is non-abelian due to the\nnon-commutativity of the spin operators. Here we develop a geometric approach\nwhich is particularly useful in the mesoscopic Stoner regime, i.e., when the\nstrong exchange interaction renders the system close the the Stoner\ninstability. We show that it is sufficient to sum over the adiabatic paths of\nthe bosonic vector field and, for these paths, the crucial role is played by\nthe Berry phase. Using these results we were able to calculate the magnetic\nsusceptibility of the dot. The latter, in close vicinity of the Stoner\ninstability point, matches very well with the exact solution [I.S.

The focus of the paper\nis on designing spaces that are well suited for temporal impulse response\nmodeling. To this end, we construct and characterize general families of\nkernels that incorporate system properties such as stability, relative degree,\nabsence of oscillatory behavior, smoothness, or delay. In addition, we discuss\nthe possibility of automatically searching over these classes by means of\nkernel learning techniques, so as to capture different modes of the system to\nbe identified.\n","330290":"  The major noise source limiting high-contrast imaging is due to the presence\nof quasi-static speckles. Speckle noise originates from wavefront errors caused\nby various independent sources, and it evolves on different timescales pending\nto their nature. An understanding of quasi-static speckles originating from\ninstrumental errors is paramount for the search of faint stellar companions.\nInstrumental speckles average to a fixed pattern, which can be calibrated to a\ncertain extent, but their temporal evolution ultimately limit this possibility.\nThis study focuses on the laboratory evidence and characterization of the\nquasi-static pinned speckle phenomenon. Specifically, we examine the coherent\namplification of the static speckle contribution to the noise variance in the\nscientific image, through its interaction with quasi-static speckles. The\nanalysis of a time series of adaptively corrected, coronagraphic images\nrecorded in the laboratory enables the characterization of the temporal\nstability of the residual speckle pattern in both direct and differential\ncoronagraphic images. We estimate that spoiled and fast-evolving quasi-static\nspeckles present in the system at the angstrom\/nanometer level are affecting\nthe stability of the static speckle noise in the final image after the\ncoronagraph.

Through\nsimultaneous observations of all the 3 lines of a Cr I triplet, combined with\nrealistic radiative transfer modeling of the data, we show that it is necessary\nto include J-state interference consistently when modeling lines with partially\ninteracting fine structure components. Polarized line formation theory that\nincludes J-state interference effects together with partial frequency\nredistribution for a two-term atom is used to model the observations.\nCollisional frequency redistribution is also accounted for. We show that the\nresonance polarization in the Cr I triplet is strongly affected by the partial\nfrequency redistribution effects in the line core and near wing peaks. The Cr I\ntriplet is quite sensitive to the temperature structure of the photospheric\nlayers. Our complete frequency redistribution calculations in semi-empirical\nmodels of the solar atmosphere cannot reproduce the observed near wing\npolarization or the cross-over of the Stokes Q\/I line polarization about the\ncontinuum polarization level that is due to the J-state interference. When\nhowever partial frequency redistribution is included, a good fit to these\nfeatures can be achieved.

This QKD-secure network was\nused by end-users through an application layer.\n","330300":"  We discuss fluctuation-dissipation relations valid under general conditions\neven out of equilibrium. The response function is expressed in terms of\nunperperturbed correlation functions, where contributions peculiar to\nnon-equilibrium can appear. Such extra terms take into account the interaction\namong the relevant degrees of freedom in the system. We illustrate the general\nformalism with two examples: driven granular systems and anomalous diffusion on\ncomb structures.\n","330301":"  Dynamical criticality has been shown to enhance information processing in\ndynamical systems, and there is evidence for self-organized criticality in\nneural networks. A plausible mechanism for such self-organization is activity\ndependent synaptic plasticity. Here, we model neurons as discrete-state nodes\non an adaptive network following stochastic dynamics. At a threshold\nconnectivity, this system undergoes a dynamical phase transition at which\npersistent activity sets in. In a low dimensional representation of the\nmacroscopic dynamics, this corresponds to a transcritical bifurcation. We show\nanalytically that adding activity dependent rewiring rules, inspired by\nhomeostatic plasticity, leads to the emergence of an attractive steady state at\ncriticality and present numerical evidence for the system's evolution to such a\nstate.\n","330302":"  Preheating and other particle production phenomena in the early Universe can\ngive rise to high- energy out-of-equilibrium fermions with an anisotropic\nstress. We develop a formalism to calculate the spectrum of gravitational waves\ndue to fermions, and apply it to a variety of scenarios after inflation. We pay\nparticular attention to regularization issues. We show that fermion production\nsources a stochastic background of gravitational waves with a significant\namplitude, but we find that typical frequencies of this new background are not\nwithin the presently accessible direct detec- tion range. However,\nsmall-coupling scenarios might still produce a signal observable by planned\ndetectors, and thus open a new window into the physics of the very early\nUniverse.\n","330303":"  Recent advances in attosecond spectroscopy techniques have fueled the\ninterest in the theoretical description of electronic processes taking place in\nthe subfemtosecond time scale. Here we study the coupled dynamic screening of a\nlocalized hole and a photoelectron emitted from a metal cluster using a\nsemi-classical model. Electron density dynamics in the cluster is calculated\nwith Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory and the motion of the\nphotoemitted electron is described classically. We show that the dynamic\nscreening of the hole by the cluster electrons affects the motion of the\nphotoemitted electron. At the very beginning of its trajectory, the\nphotoemitted electron interacts with the cluster electrons that pile up to\nscreen the hole. Within our model, this gives rise to a significant reduction\nof the energy lost by the photoelectron. Thus, this is a velocity dependent\neffect that should be accounted for when calculating the average losses\nsuffered by photoemitted electrons in metals.\n","330304":"  Context. In the absence of complete kinematic data it has not previously been\npossible to furnish accurate lists of member stars for all moving groups. There\nhas been an unresolved dispute concerning the apparent inconsistency of the\nHipparcos parallax distance to the Pleiades.\n  Aims. To find improved candidate lists for clusters and associations\nrepresented among Hipparcos stars, to establish distances, and to cast light on\nthe Pleiades distance anomaly.\n  Methods. We use a six dimensional fitting procedure to identify candidates,\nand plot CMDs for 20 of the nearest groups. We calculate the mean parallax\ndistance for all groups.\n  Results. We identify lists of candidates and calculated parallax distances\nfor 42 clusters and 45 associations represented within the Hipparcos catalogue.\nWe find agreement between parallax distance and photometric distances for the\nmost important clusters. For single stars in the Pleiades we find mean parallax\ndistance 125.6 \\pm 4.2 pc and photometric distance 132 \\pm 3 pc calibrated to\nnearby groups of similar in age and composition. This gives no reason to doubt\neither the Hipparcos database or stellar evolutionary theory.\n","330305":"  Surface-state mediated interactions between adsorbates on surfaces can be\nexploited for the fabrication of self-organized nanostructures such as\ntwo-dimensional superlattices of adatoms. Using angle-resolved photoemission we\nprovide experimental evidence that these interactions can be drastically\nmodified by adsorbate-induced alterations in the surface potential barrier.\nThis, in turn, will cause significant changes in the ordering of the\nadsorbates. For the studied case example of Cs adatoms on Ag(111) our\nmomentum-resolved measurements reveal the surface state Fermi wave vector to be\nincreased by as much as $\\sim$100% for coverages around 0.03 ML. Our results\nunravel the origin for the hitherto puzzling and unexpectedly small lattice\nconstant in the adatom superlattice observed for this system.\n","330306":"  We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence with\ngeometric rate of the common denominators of simultaneous rational interpolants\nwith a bounded number of poles. The conditions are expressed in terms of\nintrinsic properties of the system of functions used to build the approximants.\nExact rates of convergence for these denominators and the simultaneous rational\napproximants are provided.\n","330307":"  The adaptive evolution of a population under the influence of mutation and\nselection is strongly influenced by the structure of the underlying fitness\nlandscape, which encodes the interactions between mutations at different\ngenetic loci. Theoretical studies of such landscapes have been carried out for\nseveral decades, but only recently experimental fitness measurements\nencompassing all possible combinations of small sets of mutations have become\navailable. The empirical studies have spawned new questions about the\naccessibility of optimal genotypes under natural selection. Depending on\npopulation dynamic parameters such as mutation rate and population size,\nevolutionary accessibility can be quantified through the statistics of\naccessible mutational pathways (along which fitness increases monotoncially),\nor through the study of the basin of attraction of the optimal genotype under\ngreedy (steepest ascent) dynamics. Here we investigate these two measures of\naccessibility in the framework of Kauffman's $LK$-model, a paradigmatic family\nof random fitness landscapes with tunable ruggedness. The key parameter\ngoverning the strength of genetic interactions is the number $K$ of interaction\npartners of each of the $L$ sites in the genotype sequence. In general,\naccessibility increases with increasing genotype dimensionality $L$ and\ndecreases with increasing number of interactions $K$. Remarkably, however, we\nfind that some measures of accessibility behave non-monotonically as a function\nof $K$, indicating a special role of the most sparsely connected, non-trivial\ncases K=1 and 2. The relation between models for fitness landscapes and spin\nglasses is also addressed.\n","330308":"  We present a numerical model of local and nonlocal transport properties in a\nlateral spin valve structure consisting of two magnetic electrodes in contact\nwith a third perpendicular superconducting electrode. By considering the\ntransport paths for a single electron incident at the local F\/S interface - in\nterms of probabilities of crossed or local Andreev reflection, elastic\ncotunneling or quasiparticle transport - we show that this leads to nonlocal\ncharge imbalance. We compare this model with experimental data from an\naluminum-permalloy (Al\/Py) lateral spin valve geometry device and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of this simple approach in replicating experimental behavior.\n","330309":"  A large offspring number diploid biparental multilocus population model of\nMoran type is our object of study. At each timestep, a pair of diploid\nindividuals drawn uniformly at random contribute offspring to the population.\nThe number of offspring can be large relative to the total population size.\nSimilar `heavily skewed' reproduction mechanisms have been considered by\nvarious authors recently. Each diploid parental individual contributes exactly\none chromosome to each diploid offspring, and hence ancestral lineages can only\ncoalesce when in distinct individuals. A separation of timescales phenomenon is\nthus observed. A result of M\\\"{o}hle (1998) is extended to obtain convergence\nof the ancestral process to an ancestral recombination graph necessarily\nadmitting simultaneous multiple mergers of ancestral lineages. The usual\nancestral recombination graph is obtained as a special case of our model when\nthe parents contribute only one offspring to the population each time. Due to\ndiploidy and large offspring numbers, novel effects appear. For example, the\nmarginal genealogy at each locus admits simultaneous multiple mergers in up to\nfour groups, and different loci remain substantially correlated even as the\nrecombination rate grows large. Thus, genealogies for loci far apart on the\nsame chromosome remain correlated. Correlation in coalescence times for two\nloci is derived and shown to be a function of the coalescence parameters of our\nmodel. Extending the observations by Eldon and Wakeley (2008), predictions of\nlinkage disequilibrium are shown to be functions of the reproduction parameters\nof our model, in addition to the recombination rate. Correlations in ratios of\ncoalescence times between loci can be high, even when the recombination rate is\nhigh and sample size is large.\n","330310":"  Augmenting the Standard Model by three right-handed neutrinos allows for an\nanomaly-free gauge group extension G_max = U(1)_(B-L) x U(1)_(L_e-L_mu) x\nU(1)_(L_mu-L_tau). While simple U(1) subgroups of G_max have already been\ndiscussed in the context of approximate flavor symmetries, we show how two-zero\ntextures in the right-handed neutrino Majorana mass matrix can be enforced by\nthe flavor symmetry, which is spontaneously broken very economically by singlet\nscalars. These zeros lead to two vanishing minors in the low-energy neutrino\nmass matrix after the seesaw mechanism. This study may provide a new testing\nground for a zero-texture approach: the different classes of two-zero textures\nwith almost identical neutrino oscillation phenomenology can in principle be\ndistinguished by their different Z' interactions at colliders.\n","330311":"  Two particle collisions close to the horizon of the rotating nonextremal\nKerr's and Schwarzschild black holes are analyzed. For the case of multiple\ncollisions it is shown that high energy in the centre of mass frame occurs due\nto a great relative velocity of two particles and a large Lorentz factor. The\ndependence of the relative velocity on the distance to horizon is analyzed, the\ntime of movement from the point in the accretion disc to the point of\nscattering with large energy as well as the time of back movement to the Earth\nare calculated. It is shown that they have reasonable order.\n","330312":"  We have performed three-dimensional two-fluid (gas-dust) hydrodynamical\nmodels of circumstellar discs with embedded protoplanets (3 - 333 M\\oplu) and\nsmall solid bodies (radii 10cm to 10m). We find that high mass planets (\\gtrsim\nSaturn mass) open sufficiently deep gaps in the gas disc such that the density\nmaximum at the outer edge of the gap can very efficiently trap metre-sized\nsolid bodies. This allows the accumulation of solids at the outer edge of the\ngap as solids from large radii spiral inwards to the trapping region. This\nprocess of accumulation occurs fastest for those bodies that spiral inwards\nmost rapidly, typically metre-sized boulders, whilst smaller and larger objects\nwill not migrate sufficiently rapidly in the discs lifetime to benefit from the\nprocess. Around a Jupiter mass planet we find that bound clumps of solid\nmaterial, as large as several Earth masses, may form, potentially collapsing\nunder self-gravity to form planets or planetesimals. These results are in\nagreement with Lyra et al. (2009), supporting their finding that the formation\nof a second generation of planetesimals or of terrestrial mass planets may be\ntriggered by the presence of a high mass planet.\n","330313":"  In 1907 Einstein discussed with Wilhelm Wien the occurrences of superluminal\nvelocities in dispersive and absorptive media. Einstein tried to present to\nWien an expression for the group velocity in dispersive media that was based on\nhis 1905 relativistic addition theorem for velocities, which he claimed to be\nvalid for absorptive media, and to demonstrate the impossibility of\nsuperluminal velocities. However, he recognized that his expression needed an\namendment and correction. Einstein did not convince Wien, and was finally\nconfused, because he did not have the correct expression for the group velocity\nin dispersive media. However, he wrote Wien, \"it is beyond doubt that our\nelectromagnetic theories of dispersion can never yield superluminal velocity\nfor the propagation of an optical signal\".\n","330314":"  The problem of determining the splitting of the normal bundle of rational\nspace curves has been considered in the 80s in a series of papers by Ghione and\nSacchiero and by Eisenbud and Van de Ven.

We used spectropolarimetric data obtained with two telescopes - the\nNARVAL spectropolarimeter at Telescope Bernard Lyot, Pic du Midi, France and\nthe ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at CFHT, Hawaii. The data were processed using\nthe method of Least Square Deconvolution which enables to derive the mean\nphotospheric profiles of Stokes I and V parameters. We measured the\nsurface-averaged longitudinal magnetic field Bl, which varies in the interval\n0.1 - 8.2 G, the line activity indicators CaII K, H_alpha, CaII IR (854.2 nm)\nand radial velocity. By analyzing the Bl variations, was identified a possible\nrotational period P = 118 days. A single, large magnetic spot which dominates\nthe field topology is a possible explanation for the Bl and activity indicator\nvariations of Beta Ceti.\n","330317":"  The generation of intrinsic rotation by turbulence and neoclassical effects\nin tokamaks is considered. To obtain the complex dependences observed in\nexperiments, it is necessary to have a model of the radial flux of momentum\nthat redistributes the momentum within the tokamak in the absence of a\npreexisting velocity. When the lowest order gyrokinetic formulation is used, a\nsymmetry of the model precludes this possibility, making small effects in the\ngyroradius over scale length expansion necessary. These effects that are\nusually small become important for momentum transport because the symmetry of\nthe lowest order gyrokinetic formulation leads to the cancellation of the\nlowest order momentum flux. The accuracy to which the gyrokinetic equation\nneeds to be obtained to retain all the physically relevant effects is\ndiscussed.\n","330318":"  The large majority of sources detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope\nare blazars, belonging in particular to the blazar subclass of BL Lacertae\nobjects (BL Lacs). BL Lacs often have featureless optical spectra, which make\nit difficult and sometimes impossible to determine their redshifts. This\npresents a severe impediment for the use of BL Lacs to measure the spectrum of\nthe extragalactic background light through its interaction with high-energy\ngamma-ray photons. I present here high-quality optical spectroscopy of two of\nthe brightest gamma-ray blazars, namely, PKS 0447-439 and PMN J0630-24. The\nmedium-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio optical spectra show clear\nabsorption lines, which place these BL Lacs at relatively high redshifts of\nz>=1.246 for PKS 0447-439 and z>=1.238 for PMN J0630-24.\n","330319":"  General Relativity formulated with Noncommutative geometry allows one to\nobtain, via the fluctuation of Dirac operator, an exact equivalence principle:\ngeneration of curvature and torsion from flat space.

In arXiv:1110.6315 we have discussed the method to make a discrete\ntwist in a large and much discussed class of vector bundles such that the\ngeneration number gets new contributions (which can be tuned suitably) and at\nthe same time the space of bundle moduli of the new, twisted bundle is a proper\nsubspace (where the 'new', non-generic twist class exists) of the original\nbundle moduli space; one thus gets a model, closely related to the original\nmodel one started with, but with enhanced flexibility in the generation number\nand where on the other hand the number of bundle moduli is {\\em somewhat}\nreduced. Whereas in the previous paper the emphasis was on examples for the new\nflexibility in the generation number we here classify and describe explicitly\nthe twists and give the precise reduction formula (for the number of moduli)\nfor SU(5) bundles leading to an SU(5) GUT group in four dimensions. Finally we\ngive various examples where the bundle moduli space is reduced {\\em\ncompletely}: the superpotential for such {\\em rigid} bundles becomes a function\nof the complex structure moduli alone (besides the exponential Kahler moduli\ncontribution).\n","330321":"  Explicit formulae of the equations in the generalized Galileon models are\ngiven. We also develop the formulation of the reconstruction. By using the\nformulation, we can explicitly construct an action which reproduces an\narbitrary development of the expansion of the universe. The conditions how the\nreconstructed solution becomes stable and therefore it becomes an attractor\nsolution are also given. Working in the static and spherically symmetric\nspace-time, we investigate how the Vainshtein mechanism works in the\ngeneralized Galileon model and the correction to the Newton law becomes small.\nIt is also shown that any spherically symmetric and static geometry can be\nrealized by properly choosing the form of the action, which may tell that the\nsolution could have fourth hair corresponding to the scalar field.\n","330322":"  We show that the mod p cohomology of a smooth projective variety with\nsemistable reduction over K, a finite extension of Qp, embeds into the\nreduction modulo p of a semistable Galois representation with Hodge-Tate\nweights in the expected range (at least after semisimplifying, in the case of\nthe cohomological degree > 1). We prove refinements with descent data, and we\napply these results to the cohomology of unitary Shimura varieties, deducing\nvanishing results and applications to the weight part of Serre's conjecture.\n","330323":"  We report on magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements of the\ncubic helimagnet FeGe in external magnetic fields and temperatures near the\nonset of long-range magnetic order at T_C=278.2(3)K. Pronounced anomalies in\nthe field-dependent chi_ac(H) data as well as in the corresponding imaginary\npart chi\"_ac(H) reveal a precursor region around T_C in the magnetic phase\ndiagram. The occurrence of a maximum at T_0=279.6K in the zero-field specific\nheat data indicates a second order transition into a magnetically ordered\nstate. A shoulder evolves above this maximum as a magnetic field is applied.\nThe field dependence of both features coincides with crossover lines from the\nfield-polarized to the paramagnetic state deduced from chi_ac(T) at constant\nmagnetic fields. The experimental findings are analyzed within the standard\nDzyaloshinskii theory for cubic helimagnets. The remarkable multiplicity of\nmodulated precursor states and the complexity of the magnetic phase diagram\nnear the magnetic ordering are explained by the change of the character of\nsolitonic inter-core interactions and the onset of specific confined chiral\nmodulations in this area.\n","330324":"  Random tensor models for a generic complex tensor generalize matrix models in\narbitrary dimensions and yield a theory of random geometries.

The constraints have been\nshown, in the large N limit, to close a Lie algebra indexed by colored rooted\nD-ary trees yielding a first generalization of the Virasoro algebra in\narbitrary dimensions. In this paper we complete the Schwinger Dyson equations\nand the associated algebra at all orders in 1\/N.

In this\nmethod the coefficients at $k$ are determined by summing the contributions made\nby each partition whose elements sum to $k$. These contributions are found by\nassigning values to each element and multiplying by an appropriate multinomial\nfactor. This work presents a theoretical framework for the partition method for\na power series expansion. To overcome the complexity due to the contributions,\na programming methodology is created allowing more general problems to be\nstudied than envisaged originally. The methodology uses the bi-variate\nrecursive central partition (BRCP) algorithm, which is based on a tree-diagram\napproach to scanning partitions. Its main advantage is that partitions are\ngenerated in the multiplicity representation. During the development of the\ntheoretical framework, scanning over partitions was seen as a discrete\noperation with an operator $L_{P,k}[ \\cdot]$, whose summand depends on the\ncoefficients of the two series when the original function is written as a\npseudo-composite function. Simple modifications result in programs for other\noperators of specific types of partitions such as: (1) only odd or even\nelements, (2) a fixed number of elements, (3) discrete elements, (4) specific\nelements and (5) those restricted by element size. Another modification\ngenerates conjugate partitions by transposing Ferrers diagrams. The operator\napproach is then applied to the generating functions for both discrete and\nstandard partitions. The main generalisation introduces a parameter $\\omega$,\nwhose powers give the number of elements in the partitions while the\ncoefficients become polynomials in $\\omega$. Finally, power series expansions\nfor more advanced infinite products are derived, culminating in Heine's\nmulti-parameter product.\n","330327":"  Understanding what can be inferred about a multi-particle quantum system from\nonly the knowledge of its subparts is a highly non-trivial task. Clearly, if\nthe global system doesn't contain any information resource, nor do its\nsubparts. However, is the converse also true? We show that the answer to is\nnegative. We provide three two-qubit states that are non-entangled, but such\nthat any three-qubit state compatible with them is entangled. Entanglement can\nthus be deduced from the mere observation of separable reduced states. We\nextend this finding to correlations and provide local marginal correlations\nthat are only compatible with global genuinely tripartite non-local\ncorrelations.\n","330328":"  Water is present during all stages of star formation: as ice in the cold\nouter parts of protostellar envelopes and dense inner regions of circumstellar\ndisks, and as gas in the envelopes close to the protostars, in the upper layers\nof circumstellar disks and in regions of powerful outflows and shocks. In this\npaper we probe the mechanism regulating the warm gas-phase water abundance in\nthe innermost hundred AU of deeply embedded (Class~0) low-mass protostars, and\ninvestigate its chemical relationship to other molecular species during these\nstages. Millimeter wavelength thermal emission from the para-H2-18O\n3(1,3)-2(2,0) (Eu=203.7 K) line is imaged at high angular resolution (0.75\";\n190 AU) with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer towards the deeply\nembedded low-mass protostars NGC 1333-IRAS2A and NGC 1333-IRAS4A. Compact\nH2-18O emission is detected towards IRAS2A and one of the components in the\nIRAS4A binary; in addition CH3OCH3, C2H5CN, and SO2 are detected. Extended\nwater emission is seen towards IRAS2A, possibly associated with the outflow.\nThe detections in all systems suggests that the presence of water on <100 AU\nscales is a common phenomenon in embedded protostars. We present a scenario in\nwhich the origin of the emission from warm water is in a flattened disk-like\nstructure dominated by inward motions rather than rotation. The gas-phase water\nabundance varies between the sources, but is generally much lower than a\ncanonical abundance of 10^-4, suggesting that most water (>96 %) is frozen out\non dust grains at these scales. The derived abundances of CH3OCH3 and SO2\nrelative to H2-18O are comparable for all sources pointing towards similar\nchemical processes at work. In contrast, the C2H5CN abundance relative to\nH2-18O is significantly lower in IRAS2A, which could be due to different\nchemistry in the sources.\n","330329":"  The Earth acts as a gigantic heat engine driven by decay of radiogenic\nisotopes and slow cooling, which gives rise to plate tectonics, volcanoes, and\nmountain building. Another key product is the geomagnetic field, generated in\nthe liquid iron core by a dynamo running on heat released by cooling and\nfreezing to grow the solid inner core, and on chemical convection due to light\nelements expelled from the liquid on freezing. The power supplied to the\ngeodynamo, measured by the heat-flux across the core-mantle boundary (CMB),\nplaces constraints on Earth's evolution. Estimates of CMB heat-flux depend on\nproperties of iron mixtures under the extreme pressure and temperature\nconditions in the core, most critically on the thermal and electrical\nconductivities. These quantities remain poorly known because of inherent\ndifficulties in experimentation and theory. Here we use density functional\ntheory to compute these conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core\nconditions from first principles- the first directly computed values that do\nnot rely on estimates based on extrapolations. The mixtures of Fe, O, S, and Si\nare taken from earlier work and fit the seismologically-determined core density\nand inner-core boundary density jump. We find both conductivities to be 2-3\ntimes higher than estimates in current use. The changes are so large that core\nthermal histories and power requirements must be reassessed. New estimates of\nadiabatic heat-flux give 15-16 TW at the CMB, higher than present estimates of\nCMB heat-flux based on mantle convection; the top of the core must be thermally\nstratified and any convection in the upper core driven by chemical convection\nagainst the adverse thermal buoyancy or lateral variations in CMB heat flow.\nPower for the geodynamo is greatly restricted and future models of mantle\nevolution must incorporate a high CMB heat-flux and explain recent formation of\nthe inner core.\n","330330":"  We present new measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect for three\nWASP planetary systems, WASP-16, WASP-25 and WASP-31, from a combined analysis\nof their complete sets of photometric and spectroscopic data. We find a low\namplitude RM effect for WASP-16 (Teff = 5700 \\pm 150K), suggesting that the\nstar is a slow rotator and thus of an advanced age, and obtain a projected\nalignment angle of lambda = -4.2 degrees +11.0 -13.9. For WASP-25 (Teff =\n5750\\pm100K) we detect a projected spin-orbit angle of lambda = 14.6 degrees\n\\pm6.7. WASP-31 (Teff = 6300\\pm100K) is found to be well-aligned, with a\nprojected spin-orbit angle of lambda = 2.8degrees \\pm3.1. A circular orbit is\nconsistent with the data for all three systems, in agreement with their\nrespective discovery papers. We consider the results for these systems in the\ncontext of the ensemble of RM measurements made to date. We find that whilst\nWASP-16 fits the hypothesis of Winn et al. (2010) that 'cool' stars (Teff <\n6250K) are preferentially aligned, WASP-31 has little impact on the proposed\ntrend. We bring the total distribution of the true spin-orbit alignment angle,\npsi, up to date, noting that recent results have improved the agreement with\nthe theory of Fabrycky & Tremaine (2007) at mid-range angles. We also suggest a\nnew test for judging misalignment using the Bayesian Information Criterion,\naccording to which WASP-25 b's orbit should be considered to be aligned.\n","330331":"  As in our previous work [1] we address the problem to determine the splitting\nof the normal bundle of rational curves.

To\nthis end we employ a pertinent approach which allows for a mapping of the\nunderlying Schr\\\"odinger dynamics onto an adequate linear quantum Boltzmann\nequation. This approach is based on a suitable projection operator method. From\nthis Boltzmann equation we are able to numerically obtain diffusion\ncoefficients in the case of non-vanishing next-nearest neighbor hopping, i.e.,\nthe non-integrable case, whereas the diffusion coefficient diverges without\nnext-nearest neighbor hopping. For the latter case we analytically investigate\nthe decay behavior of the current with the result that arbitrarily small parts\nof the current relax arbitrarily slowly which suggests anomalous diffusive\ntransport behavior within the scope of our approach.\n","330333":"  High-temperature superconductivity remains arguably the largest outstanding\nenigma of condensed matter physics. The discovery of iron-based\nhigh-temperature superconductors has renewed the importance of understanding\nsuperconductivity in materials susceptible to magnetic order and fluctuations.\nIntriguingly they show magnetic fluctuations reminiscent of the superconducting\n(SC) cuprates, including a 'resonance' and an 'hour-glass' shaped dispersion,\nwhich provide an opportunity to new insight to the coupling between spin\nfluctuations and superconductivity. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering\ndata on Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{0.7}$Se$_{0.3}$ using excess iron concentration to tune\nbetween a SC ($y=0.02$) and a non-SC ($y=0.05$) ground states. We find\nincommensurate spectra in both samples but discover that in the one that\nbecomes SC, a constriction towards a commensurate hourglass shape develop well\nabove $T_c$. Conversely a spin-gap and concomitant spectral weight shift happen\nbelow $T_c$. Our results imply that the hourglass shaped dispersion is most\nlikely a pre-requisite for superconductivity, whereas the spin-gap and shift of\nspectral weight are consequences of superconductivity. We explain this\nobservation by pointing out that an inwards dispersion towards the commensurate\nwave-vector is needed for the opening of a spin gap to lower the magnetic\nexchange energy and hence provide the necessary condensation energy for the SC\nstate to emerge.\n","330334":"  Supernova 1987A (SN1987A) in the neighbouring Large Magellanic Cloud offers a\nsuperb opportunity to follow the evolution of a supernova and its remnant in\nunprecedented detail. Recently, far-infrared (far-IR) and sub-mm emission was\ndetected from the direction of SN1987A, which was interpreted as due to the\nemission from dust, possibly freshly synthesized in the SN ejecta. To better\nconstrain the location and hence origin of the far-IR and sub-mm emission in\nSN1987A, we have attempted to resolve the object in that part of the\nelectro-magnetic spectrum. We observed SN1987A during July-September 2011 with\nthe Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX), at a wavelength of 350 micron with\nthe Submillimetre APEX Bolometer CAmera (SABOCA) and at 870 micron with the\nLarge APEX BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA). The 350-micron image has superior angular\nresolution (8\") over that of the Herschel Space Observatory 350-micron image\n(25\"). The 870-micron observation (at 20\" resolution) is a repetition of a\nsimilar observation made in 2007. In both images, at 350 and 870 micron,\nemission is detected from SN1987A, and the source is unresolved. The flux\ndensities in the new (2011) measurements are consistent with those measured\nbefore with Herschel at 350 micron (in 2010) and with APEX at 870 micron (in\n2007). A higher dust temperature (approximately 33 K) and lower dust mass might\nbe possible than what was previously thought. The new measurements, at the\nhighest angular resolution achieved so far at far-IR and sub-mm wavelengths,\nstrengthen the constraints on the location of the emission, which is thought to\nbe close to the site of SN1987A and its circumstellar ring structures. These\nmeasurements set the stage for upcoming observations at even higher angular\nresolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).\n","330335":"  We establish upper bounds for the smallest height of a generator of a number\nfield $k$ over the rational field $\\Q$.

Even when all Liouville superoperators point to the completely\nmixed state, feedback of the measurement result may lead to a pure state, which\ncan be interpreted as selective dampening of undesired states. Using a\nmicroscopic model, we exemplify this for a single qubit, which can be purified\nin an arbitrary single-qubit state by tuning the measurement direction and two\nqubits that may be purified towards a Bell state by applying a special\ncontinuous two-local measurement. The method does not require precise knowledge\nof decoherence channels and works for large reservoir temperatures provided\nmeasurement, processing, and control can be implemented in a continuous\nfashion.\n","330337":"  We show that the classifying space functor $B: Mon \\to Top*$ from the\ncategory of topological monoids to the category of based spaces is left adjoint\nto the Moore loop space functor $\\Omega': Top*\\to Mon$ after we have localized\n$Mon$ with respect to all homomorphisms whose underlying maps are homotopy\nequivalences and $Top*$ with respect to all based maps which are (not\nnecessarily based) homotopy equivalences. It is well-known that this\nlocalization of $Top*$ exists, and we show that the localization of $Mon$ is\nthe category of monoids and homotopy classes of homotopy homomorphisms. To make\nthis statement precise we have to modify the classical definition of a homotopy\nhomomorphism, and we discuss the necessary changes. The adjunction is induced\nby an adjunction up to homotopy between the category of well-pointed monoids\nand homotopy homomorphisms and the category of well-pointed spaces. This\nadjunction is shown to lift to diagrams. As a consequence, the well-known\nderived adjunction between the homotopy colimit and the constant diagram\nfunctor can also be seen to be induced by an adjuction up to homotopy before\ntaking homotopy classes. As applications we among other things deduce a more\nalgebraic version of the group completion theorem and show that the classifying\nspace functor preserves homotopy colimits up to natural homotopy equivalences.\n","330338":"  We investigate whether fractal markets hypothesis and its focus on liquidity\nand invest- ment horizons give reasonable predictions about dynamics of the\nfinancial markets during the turbulences such as the Global Financial Crisis of\nlate 2000s.

The problem is posed as a two-player\nteam problem with a partially nested information pattern. The two players are\ngiven by an estimator and an event-trigger. The event-trigger has full state\ninformation and decides, whether the estimator shall obtain the current state\ninformation by transmitting it through a resource constrained channel. The\nobjective is to find an optimal trade-off between the mean squared estimation\nerror and the expected transmission rate. The proposed iterative algorithm\nalternates between optimizing one player while fixing the other player. It is\nshown that the solution of the algorithm converges to a linear predictor and a\nsymmetric threshold policy, if the densities of the initial state and the noise\nvariables are even and radially decreasing functions. The effectiveness of the\napproach is illustrated on a numerical example. In case of a multimodal\ndistribution of the noise variables a significant performance improvement can\nbe achieved compared to a separate design that assumes a linear prediction and\na symmetric threshold policy.\n","330340":"  Unfolding of reconstructed event properties to identify the true features of\ncollider events is a complementary method to the established practice of\ndetector calibration, and is particularly relevant to large, composite particle\ndetectors such as those at the Large Hadron Collider.

We aim at resolving the remnant\nof SN1987A for the first time in the 3-mm band (at 94 GHz). We observed the\nsource at 3-mm wavelength with a 750-m configuration of the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA). We compare the image with a recent 3-cm image and with\narchival X-ray images. We present a diffraction-limited image with a resolution\nof 0.7\", revealing the ring structure seen at lower frequencies and at other\nwavebands. The emission peaks in the eastern part of the ring. The 3-mm image\nbears resemblance to early X-ray images (from 1999-2000). We place an upper\nlimit of 1 mJy (2 \\sigma) on any discrete source of emission in the centre\n(inside of the ring). The integrated flux density at 3 mm has doubled over the\nsix years since the previous observations at 3 mm. At 3 mm - i.e. within the\noperational domain of the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array (ALMA) -\nSN1987A appears to be dominated by synchrotron radiation from the inner rim of\nthe equatorial ring, characterised by moderately-weak shocks.

Explicit formulae for the canonical\nGerstenhaber algebra structure on Ext_U(A,A) are given. The main technical\nresult constructs a Lie derivative satisfying a generalised Cartan-Rinehart\nhomotopy formula whose essence is that Tor^U(M,A) becomes for suitable right\nU-modules M a Batalin-Vilkovisky module over Ext_U(A,A), or in the words of\nNest, Tamarkin, Tsygan and others, that Ext_U(A,A) and Tor^U(M,A) form a\ndifferential calculus. As an illustration, we show how the well-known operators\nfrom differential geometry in the classical Cartan homotopy formula can be\nobtained. Another application consists in generalising Ginzburg's result that\nthe cohomology ring of a Calabi-Yau algebra is a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra to\ntwisted Calabi-Yau algebras.\n","330344":"  Pinned surface and frozen surface approximations are two commonly used\napproximations for the boundary conditions at the exposed surfaces of\nsemiconductor structures.

Until today, most studies of interstellar\nOH involved the molecule's radio wavelength hyperfine structure (hfs)\ntransitions. These lines are generally not in LTE and either masing or\nover-cooling complicates their interpretation. In the past, observations of\ntransitions between different rotational levels of OH, which are at\nfar-infrared wavelengths, have suffered from limited spectral and angular\nresolution. Since these lines have critical densities many orders of magnitude\nhigher than the radio wavelength ground state hfs lines and are emitted from\nlevels with more than 100 K above the ground state, when observed in emission,\nthey probe very dense and warm material. We probe the warm and dense molecular\nmaterial surrounding the UCHIIR\/OH maser sources W3(OH), G10.62-0.39 and NGC\n7538 IRS1 by studying the $^2\\Pi_{{1\/2}}, J = {3\/2} - {1\/2}$ rotational\ntransition of OH in emission and, toward the last source also the molecule's\n$^2\\Pi_{3\/2}, J = 5\/2 - 3\/2$ ground-state transition in absorption. We used the\nStratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to observe these OH\nlines, which are near 1.84 THz ($163 \\mu$m) and 2.51 THz ($119.3 \\mu$m). We\nclearly detect the OH lines, some of which are blended with each other.\nEmploying non-LTE radiative transfer calculations we predict line intensities\nusing models of a low OH abundance envelope versus a compact, high-abundance\nsource corresponding to the origin of the radio OH lines.\n","330347":"  Categorical quantum mechanics studies quantum theory in the framework of\ndagger-compact closed categories.\n  Using this framework, we establish a tight relationship between two key\nquantum theoretical notions: non-locality and complementarity. In particular,\nwe establish a direct connection between Mermin-type non-locality scenarios,\nwhich we generalise to an arbitrary number of parties, using systems of\narbitrary dimension, and performing arbitrary measurements, and a new stronger\nnotion of complementarity which we introduce here.\n  Our derivation of the fact that strong complementarity is a necessary\ncondition for a Mermin scenario provides a crisp operational interpretation for\nstrong complementarity. We also provide a complete classification of strongly\ncomplementary observables for quantum theory, something which has not yet been\nachieved for ordinary complementarity.\n  Since our main results are expressed in the (diagrammatic) language of\ndagger-compact categories, they can be applied outside of quantum theory, in\nany setting which supports the purely algebraic notion of strongly\ncomplementary observables. We have therefore introduced a method for discussing\nnon-locality in a wide variety of models in addition to quantum theory.\n  The diagrammatic calculus substantially simplifies (and sometimes even\ntrivialises) many of the derivations, and provides new insights. In particular,\nthe diagrammatic computation of correlations clearly shows how local\nmeasurements interact to yield a global overall effect. In other words, we\ndepict non-locality.\n","330348":"  Let $X$ be a random vector with distribution $P_{\\theta}$ where $\\theta$ is\nan unknown parameter. When estimating $\\theta$ by some estimator $\\varphi(X)$\nunder a loss function $L(\\theta,\\varphi)$, classical decision theory advocates\nthat such a decision rule should be used if it has suitable properties with\nrespect to the frequentist risk $R(\\theta,\\varphi)$. However, after having\nobserved $X=x$, instances arise in practice in which $\\varphi$ is to be\naccompanied by an assessment of its loss, $L(\\theta,\\varphi(x))$, which is\nunobservable since $\\theta$ is unknown. A common approach to this assessment is\nto consider estimation of $L(\\theta,\\varphi(x))$ by an estimator $\\delta$,\ncalled a loss estimator. We present an expository development of loss\nestimation with substantial emphasis on the setting where the distributional\ncontext is normal and its extension to the case where the underlying\ndistribution is spherically symmetric. Our overview covers improved loss\nestimators for least squares but primarily focuses on shrinkage estimators.\nBayes estimation is also considered and comparisons are made with unbiased\nestimation.\n","330349":"  We prove hyperbolicity of global minimizers for random Lagrangian systems in\ndimension 1.

Using a sample with a broad range in orientation\nangle, including radio galaxies and blazars, we find that very high power\nsources (L_kin > 10^45.5 erg s^{-1}) show a significant increase in the ratio\nof inverse Compton to synchrotron power (Compton dominance) with decreasing\norientation angle, as measured by the radio core dominance and confirmed by the\ndistribution of superluminal speeds. This increase is consistent with beaming\nexpectations for external Compton (EC) emission, but not for synchrotron self\nCompton (SSC) emission. For the lowest power jets (L_kin < 10^43.5 erg s^{-1}),\nno trend between Compton and radio core dominance is found, consistent with\nSSC. Importantly, the EC trend is not seen for moderately high power flat\nspectrum radio quasars with strong external photon fields. Coupled with the\nevidence that jet power is linked to the jet speed (Kharb et al. 2010), this\nfinding suggests that external photon fields become the dominant source of seed\nphotons in the jet comoving frame only for the faster and therefore more\npowerful jets.\n","330351":"  In order to account for the chemical composition of a stellar second\ngeneration (SG), Globular Clusters (GCs) evolution models based on the\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) scenario so far included only the yields\navailable for the massive AGB stars, while the possible role of super-AGB\nejecta was either extrapolated or not considered. In this work, we explore the\nrole of super-AGB ejecta using yields recently calculated by Ventura and\nD'Antona. Models of clusters showing extended Na-O anticorrelations, like NGC\n2808, indicate that a SG formation history similar to that outlined in our\nprevious work is required: formation of an Extreme population with very large\nhelium content from the pure ejecta of super-AGB stars, followed by formation\nof an Intermediate population by dilution of stellar ejecta with pristine gas.\nThe very O-poor Na-rich Extreme stars can be accounted for once deep-mixing is\nassumed in SG giants forming in a gas with helium abundance Y> 0.34, which\nsignificantly reduces the atmospheric oxygen content, while preserving the\nsodium abundance. On the other hand, for clusters showing a mild O-Na\nanticorrelation, like M 4, the use of the new yields broadens the range of SG\nformation routes leading to abundance patterns consistent with observations. It\nis shown that models in which SG stars form only from super-AGB ejecta promptly\ndiluted with pristine gas can reproduce the observations. We discuss the\nvariety of small helium variations occurring in this model and its relevance\nfor the horizontal branch morphology. In some of these models the duration of\nthe SG formation episode can be as short as \\sim10 Myr; the formation time of\nthe SG is thus compatible with the survival of a cooling flow in the GC,\nprevious to the explosion of the SG core collapse supernovae. We also explore\nmodels with formation of multiple populations in individual bursts, each\nlasting no longer than \\sim10 Myr.\n","330352":"  In this paper we develop mathematical models for collective cell motility.\nInitially we develop a model using a linear diffusion-advection type equation\nand fit the parameters to data from cell motility assays. This approach is\nhelpful in classifying the results of cell motility assay experiments. In\nparticular, this model can determine degrees of directed versus undirected\ncollective cell motility. Next we develop a model using a nonlinear diffusion\nterm that is able capture in a unified way directed and undirected collective\ncell motility. Finally we apply the nonlinear diffusion approach to a problem\nin tumor cell invasion, noting that neither chemotaxis or haptotaxis are\npresent in the system under consideration in this article.\n","330353":"  We put forward a simple procedure for extracting dynamical information from\nMonte Carlo simulations, by appropriate matching of the short-time diffusion\ntensor with its infinite-dilution limit counterpart, which is supposed to be\nknown.

We first recall that this is indeed the case in\nboth relativity and quantum mechanics, although in very different manners: time\nflows geometrically in relativity (i.e. as a flow of proper time in the four\ndimensional space-time), time flows abstractly in quantum mechanics (i.e. as a\nflow in the space of observables of the system). We then ask the same question\nin quantum gravity, in the light of the thermal time hypothesis of Connes and\nRovelli. The latter proposes to answer the question of time in quantum gravity\n(or at least one of its many aspects), by postulating that time is a state\ndependent notion. This means that one is able to make a notion of\ntime-as-an-abstract-flow - that we call the thermal time - emerge from the\nknowledge of both: 1) the algebra of observables of the physical system under\ninvestigation, 2) a state of thermal equilibrium of this system. Formally, this\nthermal time is similar to the abstract flow of time in quantum mechanics, but\nwe show in various examples that it may have a concrete implementation either\nas a geometrical flow, or as a geometrical flow combined with a non-geometric\naction. This indicates that in quantum gravity, time may well still be\n\"something that flows\" at some abstract algebraic level, but this does not\nnecessarily imply that time is always and only \"something that flows\" at the\ngeometric level.\n","330355":"  We study finite loop models on a lattice wrapped around a cylinder.

These are labeled by the numbers of sites N and of\ndefects d, and extend the standard modules of the original Temperley-Lieb\nalgebra. Beside the defining parameters \\beta=u^2+u^{-2} with u=e^{i\\lambda\/2}\n(weight of contractible loops) and \\alpha (weight of non-contractible loops),\nthis family also depends on a twist parameter v that keeps track of how the\ndefects wind around the cylinder.

The\ncondition for superluminal motion establishes a relation between the mass,\nenergy and total angular momentum of the particle.\n","330368":"  Let A be an exact category, that is, an extension-closed full subcategory of\nan abelian category. Firstly, we give some necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor A to have almost split sequences. Then, we study when an almost split\nsequence in A induces an almost split sequence in an exact subcategory C of A.\nIn case A has almost split sequences and C is Hom-finite Krull-Schmidt, this\nprovides a necessary and sufficient condition for C to have almost split\nsequences. Finally, we show two applications of these results.\n","330369":"  Spatially referenced data often have autocovariance functions with elliptical\nisolevel contours, a property known as geometric anisotropy. The anisotropy\nparameters include the tilt of the ellipse (orientation angle) with respect to\na reference axis and the aspect ratio of the principal correlation lengths.\nSince these parameters are unknown a priori, sample estimates are needed to\ndefine suitable spatial models for the interpolation of incomplete data. The\ndistribution of the anisotropy statistics is determined by a non-Gaussian\nsampling joint probability density. By means of analytical calculations, we\nderive an explicit expression for the joint probability density function of the\nanisotropy statistics for Gaussian, stationary and differentiable random\nfields. Based on this expression, we obtain an approximate joint density which\nwe use to formulate a statistical test for isotropy. The approximate joint\ndensity is independent of the autocovariance function and provides conservative\nprobability and confidence regions for the anisotropy parameters. We validate\nthe theoretical analysis by means of simulations using synthetic data, and we\nillustrate the detection of anisotropy changes with a case study involving\nbackground radiation exposure data. The approximate joint density provides (i)\na stand-alone approximate estimate of the anisotropy statistics distribution\n(ii) informed initial values for maximum likelihood estimation, and (iii) a\nuseful prior for Bayesian anisotropy inference.\n","330370":"  We consider one-dimensional Pauli Hamiltonians in a bounded interval with\npossibly non-self-adjoint Robin-type boundary conditions.

The electroweak symmetry breaking transition is\nassumed to occur through a spinodal instability from a super-cooled initial\nstate. We consider the creation of net Chern-Simons number, which through the\naxial anomaly is equivalent to baryon number. CP-violation is explicit in the\nscalar potential, but only in combination with P-violation is it possible for\nan asymmetry to be generated. This is introduced through the leading C- and\nP-breaking, but CP-invariant, term expected to arise upon integrating out the\nfermions in the theory.

Our study is performed within the\nmicroscopic-macroscopic method. The Strutinsky shell and pairing correction is\ncalculated for the deformed Woods-Saxon single-particle potential and the\nYukawa-plus-exponential energy is taken as a smooth part. We use parameters of\nthe model that were fitted previously to this region of nuclei. A\nhigh-dimensional deformation space, including nonaxial and\nreflection-asymmetric shapes, is used in the search for saddle points. Both\nground-state and saddle-point shapes are found with the aid of the minimization\nprocedure, with dynamical programming technique of search for saddle points.\nThe results are collected in two tables. Calculated ground-state mass-excess,\n$Q_{\\alpha $ energies, total and macroscopic energies normalized to the\nmacroscopic energy at the spherical shape, shell corrections (including\npairing) and deformations are given for each nucleus in the table one.

We discuss the corresponding VGIT problem and show that the\nresulting spaces give the final steps in the Hassett-Keel program for genus\nfour curves.\n","330374":"  A measurement of the jet activity in ttbar events produced in proton-proton\ncollisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is presented, using 2.05 fb^-1\nof integrated luminosity collected by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron\nCollider. The ttbar events are selected in the dilepton decay channel with two\nidentified b-jets from the top quark decays. Events are vetoed if they contain\nan additional jet with transverse momentum above a threshold in a central\nrapidity interval. The fraction of events surviving the jet veto is presented\nas a function of this threshold for four different central rapidity interval\ndefinitions. An alternate measurement is also performed, in which events are\nvetoed if the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets in each\nrapidity interval is above a threshold. In both measurements, the data are\ncorrected for detector effects and compared to the theoretical models\nimplemented in MC@NLO, POWHEG, ALPGEN and SHERPA.

First we construct its\ntranslation-invariant ground state and we recover the well-known fact that, due\nto the exchange term, the effective Fermi velocity is logarithmically divergent\nat zero momentum. In a second step we prove the existence of a ground state in\nthe presence of local defects and we discuss some properties of the linear\nresponse to an external electric field. All our results are non perturbative.\n","330376":"  The consideration is presented of possible neutron Lloyd's mirror\ninterferometer experiment to search for strongly coupled chameleon fields. The\nchameleon scalar fields were proposed to explain the early and late time\nacceleration of expansion of the Universe. They may produce short-range\ninteraction between particles and matter. This interaction causes phase shift\nof neutron waves in the interferometer.

Using the continuity equations for the\nelectromagnetic energy density and the Gordon momentum density, we constructed\na traceless, symmetric energy--momentum tensor for the closed system. In this\nwork, we relax the condition of a uniform index of refraction and consider a\ndielectric medium with a spatially varying index of refraction that is\nindependent of time, which essentially represents a mechanically rigid\ndielectric medium due to external constraints. Using continuity equations for\nenergy density and for Gordon momentum density, we construct a symmetric\nenergy--momentum matrix, whose four-divergence is equal to a generalized\nHelmholtz force density four-vector. Assuming that the energy-momentum matrix\nhas tensor transformation properties under a symmetry group of space-time\ncoordinate transformations, we derive the global conservation laws for the\ntotal energy, momentum, and angular momentum.\n","330378":"  We present high precision measurements of polarization rotations in the\nfrequency range from 0.1 to 2.5 THz using a polarization modulation technique.\nA motorized stage rotates a polarizer at ~80 Hz, and the resulting modulation\nof the polarization is measured by a lock-in technique. We achieve an accuracy\nof 0.05{\\deg} (900 {\\mu}rad) and a precision of 0.02{\\deg} (350 {\\mu}rad) for\nsmall rotation angles.

Based on refinements\nof the Gartner-Ellis theorem on the real line, our proof reveals pathological\nbehaviours of the asymptotic smile. In particular, we show that the condition\nassumed in Gatheral and Jacquier under which the Heston implied volatility\nconverges to the SVI parameterisation is necessary and sufficient.\n","330380":"  In an attempt to remove the systematic errors which have plagued the\ncalibration of the HII region abundance sequence, we have theoretically modeled\nthe extragalactic HII region sequence. We then used the theoretical spectra so\ngenerated in a double blind experiment to recover the chemical abundances using\nboth the classical electron temperature + ionization correction factor\ntechnique, and the technique which depends on the use of strong emission lines\n(SELs) in the nebular spectrum to estimate the abundance of oxygen. We find a\nnumber of systematic trends, and we provide correction formulae which should\nremove systematic errors in the electron temperature + ionization correction\nfactor technique. We also provide a critical evaluation of the various\nsemi-empirical SEL techniques. Finally, we offer a scheme which should help to\neliminate systematic errors in the SEL-derived chemical abundance scale for\nextragalactic HII regions.\n","330381":"  We consider Laplacian eigenfunctions in circular, spherical and elliptical\ndomains in order to discuss three kinds of high-frequency localization:\nwhispering gallery modes, bouncing ball modes, and focusing modes. Although the\nexistence of these modes was known for a class of convex domains, the\nseparation of variables for above domains helps to better understand the\n\"mechanism\" of localization, i.e. how an eigenfunction is getting distributed\nin a small region of the domain, and decays rapidly outside this region. Using\nthe properties of Bessel and Mathieu functions, we derive the inequalities\nwhich imply and clearly illustrate localization. Moreover, we provide an\nexample of a non-convex domain (an elliptical annulus) for which the\nhigh-frequency localized modes are still present. At the same time, we show\nthat there is no localization in most of rectangle-like domains. This\nobservation leads us to formulating an open problem of localization in\npolygonal domains and, more generally, in piecewise smooth convex domains.\n","330382":"  We present SUSY_FLAVOR version 2.5 - a Fortran 77 program that calculates\nlow-energy flavor observables in the general $R$-parity conserving MSSM.

SUSY_FLAVOR performs the resummation of\nall chirally enhanced corrections, i.e. takes into account the effects enhanced\nby $\\tan\\beta$ and\/or large trilinear soft mixing terms to all orders in\nperturbation theory. All calculations are done using exact diagonalization of\nthe sfermion mass matrices. Comparing to previous versions, in SUSY_FLAVOR v2.5\nparameter initialization in SLHA2 format has been significantly generalized and\nsimplified, so that program accepts without modifications most of the output\nfiles produced by other codes calculating MSSM spectra and processes. In\naddition, the routine calculating branching ratios for rare decays of top quark\nto Higgs boson has been included. The program can be obtained from\nwww.fuw.edu.pl\/susy_flavor.\n","330383":"  In many quantum computer architectures, the qubits are in close proximity to\nmetallic device elements. Metals have a high density of photon modes, and the\nfields spill out of the bulk metal because of the evanescent-wave component.\nThus thermal and quantum electromagnetic Johnson- type noise from metallic\ndevice elements can decohere nearby qubits. In this paper we use quantum\nelectrodynamics to compute the strength of this evanescent-wave Johnson noise\nas a function of distance z from a metallic half-space. Previous treatments\nhave shown unphysical divergences at z = 0. We remedy this by using a proper\nnon-local dielectric function. Decoherence rates of local qubits are\nproportional to the magnitude of electric or magnetic correlation functions\nevaluated at the qubit position. We present formulas for the decoherence rates.\nThese formulas serve as an important constraint on future device architectures.\n","330384":"  Using first principles methods, we investigate topological phase transitions\nas a function of exchange field in a Bi(111) bilayer. Evaluation of the spin\nChern number for different magnitudes of the exchange field reveals that when\nthe time reversal symmetry is broken by a small exchange field, the system\nenters the time-reversal broken topological insulator phase, introduced by Yang\n{\\it et al.} in Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 066602 (2011). After a metallic phase in\nthe intermediate region, the quantum anomalous Hall phase with non-zero Chern\nnumber emerges at a sufficiently large exchange field. We analyze the phase\ndiagram from the viewpoint of the evolution of the electronic structure, edge\nstates and transport properties, and demonstrate that different topological\nphases can be distinguished by the spin-polarization of the edge states as well\nas spin or charge transverse conductivity.\n","330385":"  In this thesis, we propose and analyze a multi-server model that captures a\nperformance trade-off between centralized and distributed processing. In our\nmodel, a fraction $p$ of an available resource is deployed in a centralized\nmanner (e.g., to serve a most-loaded station) while the remaining fraction\n$1-p$ is allocated to local servers that can only serve requests addressed\nspecifically to their respective stations.\n  Using a fluid model approach, we demonstrate a surprising phase transition in\nthe steady-state delay, as $p$ changes: in the limit of a large number of\nstations, and when any amount of centralization is available ($p>0$), the\naverage queue length in steady state scales as $\\log_{1\/(1-p)} 1\/(1-\\lambda)$\nwhen the traffic intensity $\\lambda$ goes to 1. This is exponentially smaller\nthan the usual M\/M\/1-queue delay scaling of $1\/(1-\\lambda)$, obtained when all\nresources are fully allocated to local stations ($p=0$). This indicates a\nstrong qualitative impact of even a small degree of centralization.\n  We prove convergence to a fluid limit, and characterize both the transient\nand steady-state behavior of the finite system, in the limit as the number of\nstations $N$ goes to infinity. We show that the sequence of queue-length\nprocesses converges to a unique fluid trajectory (over any finite time\ninterval, as $N$ approaches infinity, and that this fluid trajectory converges\nto a unique invariant state $v^I$, for which a simple closed-form expression is\nobtained. We also show that the steady-state distribution of the $N$-server\nsystem concentrates on $v^I$ as $N$ goes to infinity.\n","330386":"  We have developed the first self-consistent model for the observed\nlarge-amplitude oscillations along filament axes that explains the restoring\nforce and damping mechanism. We have investigated the oscillations of multiple\nthreads formed in long, dipped flux tubes through the thermal nonequilibrium\nprocess, and found that the oscillation properties predicted by our simulations\nagree with the observed behavior. We then constructed a model for the\nlarge-amplitude longitudinal oscillations that demonstrates that the restoring\nforce is the projected gravity in the tube where the threads oscillate.\nAlthough the period is independent of the tube length and the constantly\ngrowing mass, the motions are strongly damped by the steady accretion of mass\nonto the threads by thermal nonequilibrium. The observations and our model\nsuggest that a nearby impulsive event drives the existing prominence threads\nalong their supporting tubes, away from the heating deposition site, without\ndestroying them. The subsequent oscillations occur because the displaced\nthreads reside in magnetic concavities with large radii of curvature. Our model\nyields a powerful seismological method for constraining the coronal magnetic\nfield and radius of curvature of dips. Furthermore, these results indicate that\nthe magnetic structure is most consistent with the sheared-arcade model for\nfilament channels.\n","330387":"  In this paper, we present a new mutation operator, Hybrid Mutation (HPRM),\nfor a genetic algorithm that generates high quality solutions to the Traveling\nSalesman Problem (TSP).

The\nefficiency of the HPRM is compared as against some existing mutation operators;\nnamely, Reverse Sequence Mutation (RSM) and Partial Shuffle Mutation (PSM) for\nBERLIN52 as instance of TSPLIB.

This pressure wave\ntravels through the liquid and creates a fast, focused axisymmetric microjet\nwhen it is reflected at the meniscus. We numerically investigate the formation\nof this microjet using axisymmetric boundary-integral simulations, where we\nmodel the pressure wave as a pressure pulse applied on the bubble. We find a\ngood agreement between the simulations and experimental results in terms of the\ntime evolution of the jet and on all parameters that can be compared directly.\nWe present a simple analytical model that accurately predicts the velocity of\nthe jet after the pressure pulse and its maximum velocity.\n","330389":"  In this paper we investigate a tachyon field model in cosmology, provided its\ninteraction with the quintessence or phantom fields.The model takes into\naccount this interaction beyond the usual approach, in which the interaction is\nphenomenologically described by the energy flow between the matter components.\nIn our model, the interaction of tachyon field with a canonical scalar field is\ntaken into account through the interaction potential in the total Lagrangian of\nthe system, like in the case of two or more canonical scalar fields.

An important question is how the circumstellar envelopes of\nAGB stars switch from spherical symmetry to the axially symmetric structures\nfrequently observed in PNe. In many cases there is clear evidence that the\nshaping of the circumstellar envelopes of PNe is linked to the formation of\njets\/collimated winds and their interaction with the remnant AGB envelope.\nBecause of the short evolutionary time, objects in this phase are rare, but\ntheir identification provides valuable probes for testing evolutionary models.\nWe have observed (sub)millimeter CO rotational transitions with the APEX\ntelescope in a small sample of stars hosting high-velocity OH and water masers.\nThese targets are supposed to have recently left the AGB, as indicated by the\npresence of winds traced by masers, with velocities larger than observed during\nthat phase. We have carried out observations of several CO lines, ranging from\nJ=2-1 up to J=7-6. In IRAS 15452-5459 we detect a fast molecular outflow in the\ncentral region of the nebula and estimate a mass-loss rate between 1.2x10^{-4}\nMsun yr^{-1} (assuming optically thin emission) and 4.9x10^{-4} Msun yr^{-1}\n(optically thick emission). We model the SED of this target taking advantage of\nour continuum measurement at 345 GHz to constrain the emission at long\nwavelengths. For a distance of 2.5 kpc, we estimate a luminosity of 8000 Lsun\nand a dust mass of 0.01 Msun. Through the flux in the [CII] line (158 um), we\ncalculate a total mass of about 12 Msun for the circumstellar envelope, but the\nline is likely affected by interstellar contamination.\n","330391":"  Motivated by the dark energy issue, the one-loop quantization approach for a\nclass of relativistic higher order theories is discussed in some detail.

In a CPA, a lossy medium in an optical cavity with a specific\ndegree of dissipation, equal in modulus to the gain of the lasing medium, can\nperfectly absorb coherent optical waves at discrete frequencies that are the\ntime-reversed counterpart of the lasing modes. Here the concepts of\ntime-reversal of lasing and CPA are extended for optical radiation emitted by a\nlaser operated in an arbitrary (and generally highly-nonlinear) regime, i.e.\nfor transient, chaotic or periodic coherent optical fields. We prove that any\nelectromagnetic signal $E(t)$ generated by a laser system \\textbf{S} operated\nin an arbitrary regime can be perfectly absorbed by a CPA device $\\bf{S'}$\nwhich is simply realized by placing inside \\textbf{S} a broadband linear\nabsorber (attenuator) of appropriate transmittance.

We go beyond the matrix model by\ndetermining the propagator using the peeling procedure which is used to extract\nthe effective quantum Hamiltonian and the fractal dimension in agreement with\nearlier results by Ambjorn et al. With this at hand a string field theory\nformalism for multi-critical CDT is introduced and it is shown that the\nDyson-Schwinger equations match the loop equations of the matrix model.

In negative streamers, these\nelectrons can run away and contribute to energetic processes such as\nterrestrial gamma-ray and electron flashes. Moreover, electron density\nfluctuations can accelerate streamer branching. To track energies and locations\nof single electrons in relevant regions, we have developed a 3D hybrid model\nthat couples a particle model in the region of high fields and low electron\ndensities with a fluid model in the rest of the domain. Here we validate our 3D\nhybrid model on a 3D (super-)particle model for negative streamers in\novervolted gaps, and we show that it almost reaches the computational\nefficiency of a 3D fluid model. We also show that the extended fluid model\napproximates the particle and the hybrid model well until stochastic\nfluctuations become important, while the classical fluid model underestimates\nvelocities and ionization densities.

This results in superior sensitivity to\nnarrower molecular-type spectral bands, which are expected in the planet\nspectrum but are absent in the parent star. We support this idea by numerical\nsimulations which include photon and thermal noise, and show it to be feasible\nat a luminosity ratio of 10^-6 for a Sun-like parent star in the infra-red.

Extension of this\nprinciple with an additional iterative feedback loop to the demapping function\nhas proven to provide substantial error performance gain. However, the adoption\nof iterative demodulation with turbo decoding is constrained by the additional\nimplied implementation complexity, heavily impacting latency and power\nconsumption. In this paper, we analyze the convergence speed of these combined\ntwo iterative processes in order to determine the exact required number of\niterations at each level. Extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts are used\nfor a thorough analysis at different modulation orders and code rates. An\noriginal iteration scheduling is proposed reducing two demapping iterations\nwith reasonable performance loss of less than 0.15 dB.

Here we address the optimal way of extracting diffusion\nconstants from single trajectories for pure Brownian motion. It is shown that\nthe maximum likelihood estimator is much more efficient than the commonly used\nleast squares estimate.

When the shape deformation\nis canceled, we recover the same solutions previously obtained by the\nNikiforov-Uvarov method for the standard spherical Woods-Saxon potential.

In the spin-only case, it is well known that the exchange coupling\nbetween the dots combined with arbitrary single-qubit operations is sufficient\nfor universal quantum computation. The presence of the valley degeneracy in the\nelectronic band structure alters the form of the exchange coupling and in\ngeneral leads to spin-valley entanglement. Here, we show that universal quantum\ncomputation can still be performed by exchange interaction and single-qubit\ngates in the presence of the additional (valley) degree of freedom. We present\nan explicit pulse sequence for a spin-only controlled-NOT consisting of the\ngeneralized exchange coupling and single-electron spin and valley rotations. We\nalso propose state preparations and projective measurements with the use of\nadiabatic transitions between states with (1,1) and (0,2) charge distributions\nsimilar to the spin-only case, but with the additional requirement of\ncontrolling the spin and the valley Zeeman energies by an external magnetic\nfield.

The local dipole motions follow Helmholtz'\nlaw. The vortex radii scale with the energy-containing length scale. Collisions\nbetween quasi-particles lead either to annihilation (likewise rotation,\nturbulent dissipation) or to scattering (counterrotation, turbulent diffusion).\nThere are analogies with birth and death processes of population dynamics and\ntheir master equations.

A\nlinear combination of two such operators gives rise to the non-unitarity in the\nlepton mixing matrix, $U_{\\text{PMNS}}$. In this paper, we discuss the origin\nof non-unitarity at the high scale and its evolution through renormalization\ngroup running.\n","330403":"  We compute the magnetization of graphene in a magnetic field, taking into\naccount for generality the possibility of a mass gap. We concentrate on the\nphysical regime where quantum oscillations are not observed due to the effect\nof the temperature or disorder and show that the magnetization exhibits\nnon-linear behaviour as a function of the applied field, reflecting the strong\nnon-analyticity of the two-dimensional effective action of Dirac electrons. The\nnecessary values of the magnetic field to observe this non-linearity vary from\na few Teslas for very clean suspended samples to 20 - 30 Teslas for good\nsamples on substrate. In the light of these calculations, we discuss the\neffects of disorder and interactions as well as the experimental conditions\nunder which the predictions can be observed.\n","330404":"  We study the global well-posedness of a two-dimensional Boussinesq system\nwhich couples the incompressible Euler equation for the velocity and a\ntransport equation with fractional diffusion of type $|\\DD|^{\\alpha}$ for the\ntemperature. We prove that for $\\alpha>1,$ there exists a unique global\nsolution for initial data with critical regularities.\n","330405":"  The recent discovery of high temperature superconductivity in a layered iron\narsenide has led to an intensive search to optimize the superconducting\nproperties of iron-based superconductors by changing the chemical composition\nof the spacer layer that is inserted between adjacent anionic iron arsenide\nlayers. Until now, superconductivity has only been found in compounds with a\ncationic spacer layer consisting of metal ions: Li+, Na+, K+, Ba2+ or a\nPbO-type or perovskite-type oxide layer. Electronic doping is usually necessary\nto control the fine balance between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity.\nSuperconductivity has also been reported in FeSe, which contains neutral layers\nsimilar in structure to those found in the iron arsenides but without the\nspacer layer. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of Lix(NH2)y(NH3)1-yFe2Se2 (x\n~0.6 ; y ~ 0.2), with lithium ions, lithium amide and ammonia acting as the\nspacer layer, which exhibits superconductivity at 43(1) K, higher than in any\nFeSe-derived compound reported so far and four times higher at ambient pressure\nthan the transition temperature, Tc, of the parent Fe1.01Se. We have determined\nthe crystal structure using neutron powder diffraction and used magnetometry\nand muon-spin rotation data to determine the superconducting properties. This\nnew synthetic route opens up the possibility of further exploitation of related\nmolecular intercalations in this and other systems in order to greatly optimize\nthe superconducting properties in this family.\n","330406":"  We study the evolution of Wigner measures of a family of solutions of a\nSchr\\\"odinger equation with a scalar potential displaying a conical\nsingularity. Under a genericity assumption, classical trajectories exist and\nare unique, thus the question of the propagation of Wigner measures along these\ntrajectories becomes relevant. We prove the propagation for general initial\ndata.\n","330407":"  We study the NMSSM with universal Susy breaking terms (besides the Higgs\nsector) at the GUT scale. Within this constrained parameter space, it is not\ndifficult to find a Higgs boson with a mass of about 125 GeV and an enhanced\ncross section in the diphoton channel. An additional lighter Higgs boson with\nreduced couplings and a mass <123 GeV is potentially observable at the LHC. The\nNMSSM-specific Yukawa couplings lambda and kappa are relatively large and\ntan(beta) is small, such that lambda, kappa and the top Yukawa coupling are of\norder 1 at the GUT scale. The lightest stop can be as light as 105 GeV, and the\nfine-tuning is modest. WMAP constraints can be satisfied by a dominantly\nhiggsino-like LSP with substantial bino, wino and singlino admixtures and a\nmass of ~60-90 GeV, which would potentially be detectable by XENON100.\n","330408":"  Weak gravitational lensing has the potential to constrain cosmological\nparameters to high precision. However, as shown by the Shear TEsting Programmes\n(STEP) and GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy Testing (GREAT) Challenges, measuring\ngalaxy shears is a nontrivial task: various methods introduce different\nsystematic biases which have to be accounted for. We investigate how pixel\nnoise on the image affects the bias on shear estimates from a\nMaximum-Likelihood forward model-fitting approach using a sum of co-elliptical\nS\\'{e}rsic profiles, in complement to the theoretical approach of an an\nassociated paper. We evaluate the bias using a simple but realistic galaxy\nmodel and find that the effects of noise alone can cause biases of order 1-10%\non measured shears, which is significant for current and future lensing\nsurveys. We evaluate a simulation-based calibration method to create a bias\nmodel as a function of galaxy properties and observing conditions. This model\nis then used to correct the simulated measurements. We demonstrate that this\nmethod can effectively reduce noise bias so that shear measurement reaches the\nlevel of accuracy required for estimating cosmic shear in upcoming lensing\nsurveys.\n","330409":"  Weak lensing experiments are a powerful probe of cosmology through their\nmeasurement of the mass distribution of the universe. A challenge for this\ntechnique is to control systematic errors that occur when measuring the shapes\nof distant galaxies. In this paper we investigate noise bias, a systematic\nerror that arises from second order noise terms in the shape measurement\nprocess. We first derive analytical expressions for the bias of general Maximum\nLikelihood Estimators (MLEs) in the presence of additive noise. We then find\nanalytical expressions for a simplified toy model in which galaxies are modeled\nand fitted with a Gaussian with its size as a single free parameter. Even for\nthis very simple case we find a significant effect. We also extend our analysis\nto a more realistic 6-parameter elliptical Gaussian model. We find that the\nnoise bias is generically of the order of the inverse-squared signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) of the galaxies and is thus of the order of a percent for galaxies\nof SNR of 10, i.e. comparable to the weak lensing shear signal. This is nearly\ntwo orders of magnitude greater than the systematics requirements for future\nall-sky weak lensing surveys. We discuss possible ways to circumvent this\neffect, including a calibration method using simulations discussed in an\nassociated paper.\n","330410":"  We present CAVaT, a tool that performs Corpus Analysis and Validation for\nTimeML. CAVaT is an open source, modular checking utility for statistical\nanalysis of features specific to temporally-annotated natural language corpora.\nIt provides reporting, highlights salient links between a variety of general\nand time-specific linguistic features, and also validates a temporal annotation\nto ensure that it is logically consistent and sufficiently annotated. Uniquely,\nCAVaT provides analysis specific to TimeML-annotated temporal information.\nTimeML is a standard for annotating temporal information in natural language\ntext. In this paper, we present the reporting part of CAVaT, and then its\nerror-checking ability, including the workings of several novel TimeML document\nverification methods. This is followed by the execution of some example tasks\nusing the tool to show relations between times, events, signals and links. We\nalso demonstrate inconsistencies in a TimeML corpus (TimeBank) that have been\ndetected with CAVaT.\n","330411":"  The density-based action-integral functional introduced by Runge and Gross\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 52, 997(1984)] in their foundation of time-dependent\ndensity-functional theory (TDDFT) is re-examined. Based on an obvious expansion\nof the original definition, it becomes apparent that the action-integral\nfunctional is both trivial and non-stationary. It cannot be used to establish\nequations of motion for the time-evolution of quantum systems at the\ndensity-function level.\n","330412":"  The main goal of this paper is to present a way to compute Quillen homology\nof operads. The key idea is to use the notion of a shuffle operad we introduced\nearlier; this allows to compute, for a symmetric operad, the homology classes\nand the shape of the differential in its minimal model, although does not give\nan insight on the symmetric groups action on the homology. Our approach goes in\nseveral steps. First, we regard our symmetric operad as a shuffle operad, which\nallows to compute its Gr\\\"obner basis. Next, we define a combinatorial\nresolution for the \"monomial replacement\" of each shuffle operad (provided by\nthe Gr\\\"obner bases theory). Finally, we explain how to \"deform\" the\ndifferential to handle every operad with a Gr\\\"obner basis, and find explicit\nrepresentatives of Quillen homology classes for a large class of operads. We\nalso present various applications, including a new proof of Hoffbeck's PBW\ncriterion, a proof of Koszulness for a class of operads coming from commutative\nalgebras, and a homology computation for the operads of Batalin-Vilkovisky\nalgebras and of Rota-Baxter algebras.\n","330413":"  Let F be a subfield of the field R of real numbers. Equipped with the binary\narithmetic mean operation, each convex subset C of F^n becomes a commutative\nbinary mode, also called idempotent commutative medial (or entropic) groupoid.\nLet C and C' be convex subsets of F^n. Assume that they are of the same\ndimension and at least one of them is bounded, or F is the field of all\nrational numbers. We prove that the corresponding idempotent commutative medial\ngroupoids are isomorphic iff the affine space F^n over F has an automorphism\nthat maps C onto C'. We also prove a more general statement for the case when\nC,C'\\subseteq F^n are considered barycentric algebras over a unital subring of\nF that is distinct from the ring of integers. A related result, for a subring\nof R instead of a subfield F, is given in \\cite{rczgaroman2}.\n","330414":"  Temporal information conveyed by language describes how the world around us\nchanges through time. Events, durations and times are all temporal elements\nthat can be viewed as intervals. These intervals are sometimes temporally\nrelated in text. Automatically determining the nature of such relations is a\ncomplex and unsolved problem. Some words can act as \"signals\" which suggest a\ntemporal ordering between intervals. In this paper, we use these signal words\nto improve the accuracy of a recent approach to classification of temporal\nlinks.\n","330415":"  The influence of fast vibrations on energy transfer and conversion in natural\nmolecular aggregates is an issue of central interest. This article shows the\nimportant role of high-energy quantized vibrations and their non-equilibrium\ndynamics for energy transfer in photosynthetic systems with highly localized\nexcitonic states. We consider the cryptophyte antennae protein phycoerythrin\n545 and show that coupling to quantized vibrations which are quasi-resonant\nwith excitonic transitions is fundamental for biological function as it\ngenerates non-cascaded transport with rapid and wider spatial distribution of\nexcitation energy. Our work also indicates that the non-equilibrium dynamics of\nsuch vibrations can manifest itself in ultrafast beating of both excitonic\npopulations and coherences at room temperature, with time scales in agreement\nwith those reported in experiments. Moreover, we show that mechanisms\nsupporting coherent excitonic dynamics assist coupling to selected modes that\nchannel energy to preferential sites in the complex. We therefore argue that,\nin the presence of strong coupling between electronic excitations and quantized\nvibrations, a concrete and important advantage of quantum coherent dynamics is\nprecisely to tune resonances that promote fast and effective energy\ndistribution.\n","330416":"  The local Oort conjecture states that, if G is cyclic and k is an\nalgebraically closed field of characteristic p, then all G-extensions of k[[t]]\nshould lift to characteristic zero. We prove a critical case of this\nconjecture. In particular, we show that the conjecture is always true when\nv_p(|G|) \\leq 3, and is true for arbitrarily highly p-divisible cyclic groups G\nwhen a certain condition on the higher ramification filtration is satisfied.\n","330417":"  Context. Multitransition CO observations of galaxy centers have revealed that\nsignificant fractions of the dense circumnuclear gas have high kinetic\ntemperatures, which are hard to explain by pure photon excitation, but may be\ncaused by dissipation of turbulent energy.\n  Aims. We aim to determine to what extent mechanical heating should be taken\ninto account while modelling PDRs. To this end, the effect of dissipated\nturbulence on the thermal and chemical properties of PDRs is explored. Methods.\nClouds are modelled as 1D semi-infinite slabs whose thermal and chemical\nequilibrium is solved for using the Leiden PDR-XDR code.\n  Results. In a steady-state treatment, mechanical heating seems to play an\nimportant role in determining the kinetic temperature of the gas in molecular\nclouds. Particularly in high-energy environments such as starburst galaxies and\ngalaxy centers, model gas temperatures are underestimated by at least a factor\nof two if mechanical heating is ignored. The models also show that CO, HCN and\nH2 O column densities increase as a function of mechanical heating. The HNC\/HCN\nintegrated column density ratio shows a decrease by a factor of at least two in\nhigh density regions with n \\sim 105 cm-3, whereas that of HCN\/HCO+ shows a\nstrong dependence on mechanical heating for this same density range, with\nboosts of up to three orders of magnitude.\n  Conclusions. The effects of mechanical heating cannot be ignored in studies\nof the molecular gas excitation whenever the ratio of the star formation rate\nto the gas density is close to, or exceeds, 7 \\times 10-6 M yr-1 cm4.5 . If\nmechanical heating is not included, predicted column densities are\nunderestimated, sometimes even by a few orders of magnitude. As a lower bound\nto its importance, we determined that it has non-negligible effects already\nwhen mechanical heating is as little as 1% of the UV heating in a PDR.\n","330418":"  Quantum vortices in the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase of QCD have bosonic\ndegrees of freedom, called the orientational zero modes, localized on them. We\nshow that the orientational zero modes are electromagnetically charged. As a\nresult, a vortex in the CFL phase nontrivially interacts with photons. We show\nthat a lattice of vortices acts as a polarizer of photons with wavelengths\nlarger than some critical length.\n","330419":"  We describe the University of Sheffield system used in the TempEval-2\nchallenge, USFD2. The challenge requires the automatic identification of\ntemporal entities and relations in text. USFD2 identifies and anchors temporal\nexpressions, and also attempts two of the four temporal relation assignment\ntasks. A rule-based system picks out and anchors temporal expressions, and a\nmaximum entropy classifier assigns temporal link labels, based on features that\ninclude descriptions of associated temporal signal words. USFD2 identified\ntemporal expressions successfully, and correctly classified their type in 90%\nof cases. Determining the relation between an event and time expression in the\nsame sentence was performed at 63% accuracy, the second highest score in this\npart of the challenge.\n","330420":"  Exact results in supersymmetric Chern-Simons and N=2 Yang-Mills theories can\nbe used to examine the quantum behavior of observables and the structure of the\nperturbative series. For the U(2) x U(2) ABJM model, we determine the\nasymptotic behavior of the perturbative series for the partition function and\nwrite it as a Borel transform. Similar results are obtained for N=2 SU(2) super\nYang-Mills theory with four fundamental flavors and in N=2* super Yang-Mills\ntheory, for the partition function as well as for the expectation values for\nWilson loop and 't Hooft loop operators (in the 0 and 1 instanton sectors). In\nall examples, one has an alternate perturbation series where the coefficient of\nthe nth term increases as n!, and the perturbation series are Borel summable.\nWe also calculate the expectation value for a Wilson loop operator in the N=2*\nSU(N) theory at large N in different regimes of the 't Hooft gauge coupling and\nmass parameter. For large masses, the calculation reproduces the running gauge\ncoupling for the pure N=2 SYM theory.\n","330421":"  In this paper we present RTMML, a markup language for the tenses of verbs and\ntemporal relations between verbs. There is a richness to tense in language that\nis not fully captured by existing temporal annotation schemata. Following\nReichenbach we present an analysis of tense in terms of abstract time points,\nwith the aim of supporting automated processing of tense and temporal relations\nin language. This allows for precise reasoning about tense in documents, and\nthe deduction of temporal relations between the times and verbal events in a\ndiscourse. We define the syntax of RTMML, and demonstrate the markup in a range\nof situations.\n","330422":"  We investigate the fundamental concept of a closed quantum subgroup of a\nlocally compact quantum group. Two definitions - one due to S.Vaes and one due\nto S.L.Woronowicz - are analyzed and relations between them discussed. Among\nmany reformulations we prove that the former definition can be phrased in terms\nof quasi-equivalence of representations of quantum groups while the latter can\nbe related to an old definition of Podle\\'s from the theory of compact quantum\ngroups. The cases of classical groups, duals of classical groups, compact and\ndiscrete quantum groups are singled out and equivalence of the two definitions\nis proved in the relevant context. A deep relationship with the quantum group\ngeneralization of Herz restriction theorem from classical harmonic analysis is\nalso established, in particular, in the course of our analysis we give a new\nproof of Herz restriction theorem.\n","330423":"  Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) provide highly multiplexed\narrays of detectors that can be configured to operate from the sub-millimeter\nto the X-ray regime. We have examined two tungsten silicide alloys (W5Si3 and\nWSi2), which are dense alloys that provide a critical temperature tunable with\ncomposition, large kinetic inductance fraction, and high normal-state\nresistivity. We have fabricated superconducting resonators and provide\nmeasurement data on critical temperature, surface resistance, quality factor,\nnoise, and quasiparticles lifetime. Tungsten silicide appears to be promising\nfor microwave kinetic inductance detectors.\n","330424":"  Khovanov has given a construction of the Khovanov-Rozansky link invariants\n(categorifying the HOMFLYPT invariant) using Hochschild cohomology of 2-braid\ngroups. We give a direct proof that his construction does give link invariants.\nWe show more generally that, for any finite Coxeter group, his construction\nprovides a Markov \"2-trace\", and we actually show that the invariant takes\nvalue in suitable derived categories. This makes more precise a result of\nTrafim Lasy who has shown that, after taking the class in K_0, this provides a\nMarkov trace.\n","330425":"  Automatic temporal ordering of events described in discourse has been of\ngreat interest in recent years. Event orderings are conveyed in text via va\nrious linguistic mechanisms including the use of expressions such as \"before\",\n\"after\" or \"during\" that explicitly assert a temporal relation -- temporal\nsignals. In this paper, we investigate the role of temporal signals in temporal\nrelation extraction and provide a quantitative analysis of these expres sions\nin the TimeBank annotated corpus.\n","330426":"  R-matrix method is used to construct supersymmetric extensions of theta -\nEuclidean group preserving N = 1\/2 supersymmetry and its three- parameter\ngeneralization. These quantum symmetry supergroups can be considered as global\ncounterparts of appropriately twisted Euclidean superalgebras. The\ncorresponding generalized global symmetry transformations act on deformed\nsuperspaces as the usual ones do on undeformed spaces. However, they depend on\nnon(anti)commuting parameters satisfying (anti)commutation relations defined by\nrelevant R matrix.\n","330427":"  We use the classical correlation between a quantum system being measured and\nits measurement apparatus to analyze the amount of information being retrieved\nin a quantum measurement process. Accounting for decoherence of the apparatus,\nwe show that these correlations may have a sudden transition from a decay\nregime to a constant level. This transition characterizes a non-asymptotic\nemergence of the pointer basis, while the system-apparatus can still be quantum\ncorrelated. We provide a formalization of the concept of emergence of a pointer\nbasis in an apparatus subject to decoherence. This contrast of the pointer\nbasis emergence to the quantum to classical transition is demonstrated in an\nexperiment with polarization entangled photon pairs.\n","330428":"  In this paper we prove that random $d$--regular graphs with $d\\geq 3$ have\ntraffic congestion of the order $O(n\\log_{d-1}^{3}(n))$ where $n$ is the number\nof nodes and geodesic routing is used.

Due to superradiant\ninstability, the axion field extracts the rotational energy of the BH and the\nnonlinear self-interaction becomes important as the field grows larger. We\npresent clear numerical evidences that the nonlinear effect leads to a collapse\nof the axion cloud and a subsequent explosive phenomena, which is analogous to\nthe \"bosenova\" observed in experiments of Bose-Einstein condensate. The\ncriterion for the onset of the bosenova collapse is given. We also discuss the\nreason why the bosenova happens by constructing an effective theory of a\nwavepacket model under the nonrelativistic approximation.\n","330430":"  One aim of this paper is to develop some aspects of the theory of monoidal\nderivators. The passages from categories and model categories to derivators\nboth respect monoidal objects and hence give rise to natural examples. We also\nintroduce additive derivators and show that the values of strong, additive\nderivators are canonically pretriangulated categories. Moreover, the center of\nadditive derivators allows for a convenient formalization of linear structures\nand graded variants thereof in the stable situation. As an illustration of\nthese concepts, we discuss some derivators related to chain complexes and\nsymmetric spectra.\n","330431":"  The quantum dynamics of transport networks in the presence of noisy\nenvironments have recently received renewed attention with the discovery of\nlong-lived coherences in different photosynthetic complexes. This experimental\nevidence has raised two fundamental questions: Firstly, what are the mechanisms\nsupporting long-lived coherences and secondly, how can we assess the possible\nfunctional role that the interplay of noise and quantum coherence might play in\nthe seemingly optimal operation of biological systems under natural conditions?\nHere we review recent results, illuminate them at the hand of two paradigmatic\nsystems, the Fenna-Matthew-Olson (FMO) complex and the light harvesting complex\nLHII, and present new progress on both questions. In particular we introduce\nthe concept of the phonon antennae and discuss the possible microscopic origin\nor long-lived electronic coherences.\n","330432":"  This paper describes the University of Sheffield's entry in the 2011 TAC KBP\nentity linking and slot filling tasks. We chose to participate in the\nmonolingual entity linking task, the monolingual slot filling task and the\ntemporal slot filling tasks. We set out to build a framework for\nexperimentation with knowledge base population. This framework was created, and\napplied to multiple KBP tasks. We demonstrated that our proposed framework is\neffective and suitable for collaborative development efforts, as well as useful\nin a teaching environment. Finally we present results that, while very modest,\nprovide improvements an order of magnitude greater than our 2010 attempt.\n","330433":"  In this work, we present a supersymmetric extension of the quantum spherical\nmodel, both in components and also in the superspace formalisms.

The existence of critical points (classical and\nquantum) is analyzed and the corresponding critical dimensions are determined.\n","330434":"  In this paper we present the first on-sky results with the fibered aperture\nmasking instrument FIRST. Its principle relies on the combination of spatial\nfiltering and aperture masking using single-mode fibers, a novel technique that\nis aimed at high dynamic range imaging with high angular resolution. The\nprototype has been tested with the Shane 3-m telescope at Lick Observatory. The\nentrance pupil is divided into subpupils feeding single-mode fibers. The flux\ninjection into the fibers is optimized by a segmented mirror. The beams are\nspectrally dispersed and recombined in a non-redundant exit configuration in\norder to retrieve all contrasts and phases independently. The instrument works\nat visible wavelengths between 600 nm and 760 nm and currently uses nine of the\n30 43 cm subapertures constituting the full pupil. First fringes were obtained\non Vega and Deneb. Stable closure phases were measured with standard deviations\non the order of 1 degree. Closure phase precision can be further improved by\naddressing some of the remaining sources of systematic errors. While the number\nof fibers used in the experiment was too small to reliably estimate visibility\namplitudes, we have measured closure amplitudes with a precision of 10 % in the\nbest case. These first promising results obtained under real observing\nconditions validate the concept of the fibered aperture masking instrument and\nopen the way for a new type of ground-based instrument working in the visible.\nThe next steps of the development will be to improve the stability and the\nsensitivity of the instrument in order to achieve more accurate closure phase\nand visibility measurements, and to increase the number of sub-pupils to reach\nfull pupil coverage.\n","330435":"  Automatic annotation of temporal expressions is a research challenge of great\ninterest in the field of information extraction. Gold standard\ntemporally-annotated resources are limited in size, which makes research using\nthem difficult. Standards have also evolved over the past decade, so not all\ntemporally annotated data is in the same format. We vastly increase available\nhuman-annotated temporal expression resources by converting older format\nresources to TimeML\/TIMEX3. This task is difficult due to differing annotation\nmethods. We present a robust conversion tool and a new, large temporal\nexpression resource. Using this, we evaluate our conversion process by using it\nas training data for an existing TimeML annotation tool, achieving a 0.87 F1\nmeasure -- better than any system in the TempEval-2 timex recognition exercise.\n","330436":"  We endow the de Rham cohomology of any Poisson or Jacobi manifold with a\nnatural homotopy Frobenius manifold structure.

There is a substantial amount of algorithms\navailable that use visual features (color, shape, texture). Shape feature has\nattracted much attention from researchers that there are many shape\nrepresentation and description algorithms in literature. These shape image\nrepresentation and description algorithms are usually not application\nindependent or robust, making them undesirable for generic shape description.\nThis paper presents an object shape representation using Kernel Density Feature\nPoints Estimator (KDFPE). In this method, the density of feature points within\ndefined rings around the centroid of the image is obtained. The KDFPE is then\napplied to the vector of the image. KDFPE is invariant to translation, scale\nand rotation. This method of image representation shows improved retrieval rate\nwhen compared to Density Histogram Feature Points (DHFP) method. Analytic\nanalysis is done to justify our method, which was compared with the DHFP to\nprove its robustness.\n","330438":"  We prove a formal power series identity, relating the arithmetic\nsum-of-divisors function to commuting triples of permutations.

We focus on quenches within the ordered phase. The long-time behaviour\nis obtained analytically by a resummation of the leading divergent terms in a\nform-factor expansion for $<\\sigma(t)>$. Our main result is the development of\na method for treating divergences associated with working directly in the field\ntheory limit. We recover the scaling limit of the corresponding result by\nCalabrese et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{106}, 227203 (2011)], which was\nobtained for the lattice model.

ARGOS relays on 3\nRayleigh beacons to sense the lower layers of the atmosphere achieving almost\n100% sky coverage. The ground layer AO correction is allowed by the 2 adaptive\nsecondaries of the LBT. This PhD thesis first discusses a study based on\nnumerical simulations and aimed to evaluate the performance of ARGOS. This work\nhas been carried out using CAOS and representing in the code most of the\nfeatures that characterize the system itself: as the laser beacon propagation\nin the atmosphere, the SH type wavefront sensing, the AO reconstruction and\nclosed loop delays and the atmosphere tip-tilt sensing done using a NGS and a\nquad-cell type sensor. The results obtained in this study are in agreement and\ndefinitively confirm the performance evaluated in the phase studies of the\nproject. This study shows that ARGOS is able to produce a reduction of a factor\n2 of the seeing bringing to a gain of a factor 4 in the integration time\nrequired by LUCI. This PhD thesis reports also the optical design and\noptimization of both the ARGOS dichroic window, used to separate the laser\nlight from the science light, and the LGS WFS, that evaluates the ground layer\naberrations averaging the SH measurements in the direction of the 3 LGS. For\nboth of the subsystems the optimization process is analyzed.

In both 3 and 4\ndimensions, we obtain a bubble bound proving the suppression of singular\ntopologies with respect to the first terms in the perturbative expansion (in\nthe cut-off). We also prove a new, stronger jacket bound than the one currently\navailable in the literature. We expect these results to be relevant for other\ntensorial field theories of this type, as well as for group field theory models\nfor 4d quantum gravity.\n","330442":"  Varying the Standard Model (SM) fermion Yukawa couplings universally by a\ngeneric positive scale factor ($F_{Yu}$), we study the phenomenological fit to\nthe current available experimental results for the Higgs boson search at hadron\ncolliders.

Thus, our scenario and the SM Higgs are\nindistinguishable in the inclusive $H\\to \\gamma\\gamma$ channel. The current\nmeasurements on direct Yukawa coupling strength in the $H\\to b\\bar{b}\/\\tau\\tau$\nchannel are not precise enough to fix the scale factor $F_{Yu}$. The most\npromising is the vector-boson-fusion channel in which the CMS has already\nobserved possible suppression effect on the Yukawa couplings.

Question answering (QA) systems often perform\ninformation retrieval at an initial stage. Information retrieval (IR)\nperformance, provided by engines such as Lucene, places a bound on overall\nsystem performance. For example, no answer bearing documents are retrieved at\nlow ranks for almost 40% of questions.\n  In this paper, answer texts from previous QA evaluations held as part of the\nText REtrieval Conferences (TREC) are paired with queries and analysed in an\nattempt to identify performance-enhancing words. These words are then used to\nevaluate the performance of a query expansion method.\n  Data driven extension words were found to help in over 70% of difficult\nquestions. These words can be used to improve and evaluate query expansion\nmethods. Simple blind relevance feedback (RF) was correctly predicted as\nunlikely to help overall performance, and an possible explanation is provided\nfor its low value in IR for QA.\n","330444":"  We present a study of direct laser driven electron acceleration and scaling\nof attosecond bunch compression in unbound vacuum. Simple analytical\nexpressions and detailed three-dimensional numerical calculations including\nspace charge reveal the conditions for compression to attosecond electron\nsheets. Intermediate emittance minima suitable for brilliant x-ray generation\nvia coherent inverse Compton scattering (ICS) are predicted. We verify the\ncoherent emission properties of the resulting x-ray fields and demonstrate\nfeasability for realistic laser parameters.\n","330445":"  In Nature, the primary goal of any network is to survive. This is less\nobvious for engineering networks (electric power, gas, water, transportation\nsystems etc.) that are expected to operate under normal conditions most of\ntime. As a result, the ability of a network to withstand massive sudden damage\ncaused by adverse events (or survivability) has not been among traditional\ngoals in the network design. Reality, however, calls for the adjustment of\ndesign priorities. As modern networks develop toward increasing their size,\ncomplexity, and integration, the likelihood of adverse events increases too due\nto technological development, climate change, and activities in the political\narena among other factors. Under such circumstances, a network failure has an\nunprecedented effect on lives and economy. To mitigate the impact of adverse\nevents on the network operability, the survivability analysis must be conducted\nat the early stage of the network design. Such analysis requires the\ndevelopment of new analytical and computational tools. Computational analysis\nof the network survivability is the exponential time problem at least. The\ncurrent paper describes a new algorithm, in which the reduction of the\ncomputational complexity is achieved by mapping an initial network topology\nwith multiple sources and sinks onto a set of simpler smaller topologies with\nmultiple sources and a single sink. Steps for further reducing the time and\nspace expenses of computations are also discussed.\n","330446":"  A post-Markovian master equation has been recently proposed as a tool to\ndescribe the evolution of a system coupled to a memory-keeping environment [A.\nShabani and D. A. Lidar, Phys. Rev. A 71, 020101 (R) (2005)]. For a single\nqubit affected by appropriately chosen environmental conditions, the\ncorresponding dynamics is always legitimate and physical. Here we extend such\nsituation to the case of two qubits, only one of which experiences the\nenvironmental effects. We show how, despite the innocence of such an extension,\nthe introduction of the second qubit should be done cum grano salis to avoid\nconsequences such as the breaking of the positivity of the associated dynamical\nmap. This hints at the necessity of using care when adopting phenomenologically\nderived models for evolutions occurring outside the Markovian framework.\n","330447":"  We consider the rotating non-extremal black hole of N=2 D=4 STU supergravity\ncarrying three magnetic charges and one electric charge. We show that its\nsubtracted geometry is obtained by applying a specific SO(4,4) Harrison\ntransformation on the black hole. As previously noted, the resulting subtracted\ngeometry is a solution of the N=2 S=T=U supergravity.\n","330448":"  We map the full extent of a rich massive young cluster in the Cep OB3b\nassociation with the IRAC and MIPS instruments aboard the {\\it Spitzer} Space\nTelescope and the ACIS instrument aboard the $\\it{Chandra}$ X-Ray Observatory.\nAt 700 pc, it is revealed to be the second nearest large ($>1000$ member),\nyoung ($< 5$ Myr) cluster known. In contrast to the nearest large cluster, the\nOrion Nebula Cluster, Cep OB3b is only lightly obscured and is mostly located\nin a large cavity carved out of the surrounding molecular cloud. Our infrared\nand X-ray datasets, as well as visible photometry from the literature, are used\nto take a census of the young stars in Cep OB3b. We find that the young stars\nwithin the cluster are concentrated in two sub-clusters; an eastern\nsub-cluster, near the Cep B molecular clump, and a western sub-cluster, near\nthe Cep F molecular clump. Using our census of young stars, we examine the\nfraction of young stars with infrared excesses indicative of circumstellar\ndisks. We create a map of the disk fraction throughout the cluster and find\nthat it is spatially variable. Due to these spatial variations, the two\nsub-clusters exhibit substantially different average disk fractions from each\nother: $32% \\pm 4%$ and $50% \\pm 6%$. We discuss whether the discrepant disk\nfractions are due to the photodestruction of disks by the high mass members of\nthe cluster or whether they result from differences in the ages of the\nsub-clusters. We conclude that the discrepant disk fractions are most likely\ndue to differences in the ages.\n","330449":"  In this note we review the construction of topologically gauged M2 branes\nwith 6 supersymmetries and discuss some of its properties. This is done using\nthe 3-algebra formulation thereby covering all possible gauge groups. We will\nelaborate upon 1) the fundamental identity and its solutions noting, provided\nthese gauged theories describe stacks of branes, the case of a single brane, 2)\nthe chiral point solution to the field equations (occuring even for a single\nbrane) that breaks the superconformal symmetries down to those of AdS_3 (TMG)\nsupergravity, 3) physical parameters and how they scale in the compactification\nfrom 11d to 10d and give rise to matter theories in curved space-times, and\nfinally 4) a more speculative comment on \"sequential AdS\/CFT\". Here we propose\nthat the superconformal symmetry breaking in topologically gauged theories\nleads to the sequence AdS_4\/CFT_3 -> AdS_3\/CFT_2 and that the higgsing in the\n3d boundary theory is related to a change of foliation in the AdS_4 bulk\ntheory.\n","330450":"  Magnetic excitations in a Ni$_4$ magnetic molecule were investigated by\ninelastic neutron scattering and bulk susceptibility ($\\chi_\\text{bulk}$)\ntechniques. The magnetic excitation spectrum obtained from the inelastic\nneutron scattering experiments exhibits three modes at energy transfers of\n$\\hbar\\omega=0.5$, 1.35, and 1.6 meV. We show that the energy, momentum, and\ntemperature dependences of the inelastic neutron scattering data and\n$\\chi_\\text{bulk}$ can be well reproduced by an effective spin Hamiltonian\nconsisted of intra-molecule exchange interactions, a single-ionic anisotropy,\nbiquadratic interactions, and Zeeman term. Under a hydrostatic pressure, the\nbulk magnetization decreases with increasing pressure, which along with the\nbiquadratic term indicates spin-lattice coupling present in this system.\n","330451":"  We study the asymptotic behavior of a diffusion process with small diffusion\nin a domain $D$. This process is reflected at $\\partial D$ with respect to a\nco-normal direction pointing inside $D$. Our asymptotic result is used to study\nthe long time behavior of the solution of the corresponding parabolic PDE with\nNeumann boundary condition.\n","330452":"  In the past few decades detailed observations of radio and X-rays emission\nfrom massive binary systems revealed a whole new physics present in such\nsystems. Both thermal and non-thermal components of this emission indicate that\nmost of the radiation at these bands originates in shocks. OB and WR stars\npresent supersonic and massive winds that, when colliding, emit largely due to\nthe free-free radiation. The non-thermal radio and X-ray emissions are due to\nsynchrotron and inverse compton processes, respectively. In this case, magnetic\nfields are expected to play an important role on the emission distribution. In\nthe past few years the modeling of the free-free and synchrotron emissions from\nmassive binary systems have been based on purely hydrodynamical simulations,\nand ad hoc assumptions regarding the distribution of magnetic energy and the\nfield geometry. In this work we provide the first full MHD numerical\nsimulations of wind-wind collision in massive binary systems. We study the\nfree-free emission characterizing its dependence on the stellar and orbital\nparameters. We also study self-consistently the evolution of the magnetic field\nat the shock region, obtaining also the synchrotron energy distribution\nintegrated along different lines of sight. We show that the magnetic field in\nthe shocks is larger than that obtained when the proportionality between $B$\nand the plasma density is assumed. Also, we show that the role of the\nsynchrotron emission relative to the total radio emission has been\nunderestimated.\n","330453":"  The study of time-dependent, many-body transport phenomena is increasingly\nwithin reach of ultra-cold atom experiments. We show that the introduction of\nspatially inhomogeneous interactions, e.g., generated by optically-controlled\ncollisions, induce negative differential conductance in the transport of atoms\nin 1D optical lattices. Specifically, we simulate the dynamics of interacting\nfermionic atoms via a micro-canonical transport formalism within both\nmean-field and a higher-order approximation, as well as with time-dependent\nDMRG. For weakly repulsive interactions, a quasi steady-state atomic current\ndevelops that is similar to the situation occurring for electronic systems\nsubject to an external voltage bias. At the mean-field level, we find that this\natomic current is robust against the details of how the interaction is switched\non. Further, a conducting-to-nonconducting transition exists when the\ninteraction imbalance exceeds some threshold from both our approximate and\ntime-dependent DMRG simulations. This transition is preceded by the atomic\nequivalent of negative differential conductivity observed in transport across\nsolid-state structures.\n","330454":"  A method is proposed to measure the relative azimuthal angle distributions\ninvolving two or more event planes of different order in heavy ion collisions\nusing a Fourier analysis technique. The analysis procedure is demonstrated for\ncorrelations involving two and three event planes (Phi_n, Phi_m and Phi_h). The\nFourier coefficients of these distributions are found to coincide with\npreviously proposed correlators, such as cos(6Phi_2-6Phi_3) and\ncos(Phi_1+2Phi_2-3Phi_3) etc, hence the method provides a natural framework for\nstudying these correlators at the same time. Using a Monte Carlo Glauber model\nto simulate Au+Au collisions with fluctuating initial geometry, we are able to\nidentify several new two- or three-plane correlators that have sizable\nmagnitudes and should be measured experimentally.\n","330455":"  The Neumann problem with a small parameter\n$$(\\dfrac{1}{\\epsilon}L_0+L_1)u^\\epsilon(x)=f(x) \\text{for} x\\in G,\n.\\dfrac{\\partial u^\\epsilon}{\\partial \\gamma^\\epsilon}(x)|_{\\partial G}=0$$ is\nconsidered in this paper. The operators $L_0$ and $L_1$ are self-adjoint second\norder operators. We assume that $L_0$ has a non-negative characteristic form\nand $L_1$ is strictly elliptic. The reflection is with respect to inward\nco-normal unit vector $\\gamma^\\epsilon(x)$. The behavior of\n$\\lim\\limits_{\\epsilon\\downarrow 0}u^\\epsilon(x)$ is effectively described via\nthe solution of an ordinary differential equation on a tree. We calculate the\ndifferential operators inside the edges of this tree and the gluing condition\nat the root. Our approach is based on an analysis of the corresponding\ndiffusion processes.\n","330456":"  The physical relationship between low-excitation gas filaments at ~10^4 K,\nseen in optical line emission, and diffuse X-ray emitting coronal gas at ~10^7\nK in the centers of many galaxy clusters is not understood. It is unclear\nwhether the ~10^4 K filaments have cooled and condensed from the ambient hot\n(~10^7 K) medium or have some other origin such as the infall of cold gas in a\nmerger, or the disturbance of an internal cool reservoir of gas by nuclear\nactivity. Observations of gas at intermediate temperatures (~10^5-10^6 K) can\npotentially reveal whether the central massive galaxies are gaining cool gas\nthrough condensation or losing it through conductive evaporation and hence\nidentify plausible scenarios for transport processes in galaxy cluster gas.\nHere we present spectroscopic detection of ~10^5 K gas spatially associated\nwith the H-alpha filaments in a central cluster galaxy, M87 in the Virgo\nCluster. The measured emission-line fluxes from triply ionized carbon (CIV 1549\nA) and singly ionized helium (HeII 1640 A) are consistent with a model in which\nthermal conduction determines the interaction between hot and cold phases.\n","330457":"  Previous studies have demonstrated that putatively single nitrogen-type\nWolf-Rayet stars (WN stars) without known companions are X-ray sources.\nHowever, almost all WN star X-ray detections so far have been of earlier WN2 -\nWN6 spectral subtypes. Later WN7 - WN9 subtypes (also known as WNL stars) have\nproved more difficult to detect, an important exception being WR 79a (WN9ha).\nWe present here new X-ray detections of the WNL stars WR 16 (WN8h) and WR 78\n(WN7h). These new results, when combined with previous detections, demonstrate\nthat X-ray emission is present in WN stars across the full range of spectral\ntypes, including later WNL stars. The two WN8 stars observed to date (WR 16 and\nWR 40) show unusually low X-ray luminosities (Lx) compared to other WN stars,\nand it is noteworthy that they also have the lowest terminal wind speeds\n(v_infty). Existing X-ray detections of about a dozen WN stars reveal a trend\nof increasing Lx with wind luminosity Lwind = (1\/2) M_dot v_infty^2, suggesting\nthat wind kinetic energy may play a key role in establishing X-ray luminosity\nlevels in WN stars.\n","330458":"  We study an abstract optimal auction problem for a single good or service.\nThis problem includes environments where agents have budgets, risk preferences,\nor multi-dimensional preferences over several possible configurations of the\ngood (furthermore, it allows an agent's budget and risk preference to be known\nonly privately to the agent). These are the main challenge areas for auction\ntheory. A single-agent problem is to optimize a given objective subject to a\nconstraint on the maximum probability with which each type is allocated,\na.k.a., an allocation rule. Our approach is a reduction from multi-agent\nmechanism design problem to collection of single-agent problems. We focus on\nmaximizing revenue, but our results can be applied to other objectives (e.g.,\nwelfare).\n  An optimal multi-agent mechanism can be computed by a linear\/convex program\non interim allocation rules by simultaneously optimizing several single-agent\nmechanisms subject to joint feasibility of the allocation rules. For\nsingle-unit auctions, Border \\citeyearpar{B91} showed that the space of all\njointly feasible interim allocation rules for $n$ agents is a\n$\\NumTypes$-dimensional convex polytope which can be specified by $2^\\NumTypes$\nlinear constraints, where $\\NumTypes$ is the total number of all agents' types.\nConsequently, efficiently solving the mechanism design problem requires a\nseparation oracle for the feasibility conditions and also an algorithm for\nex-post implementation of the interim allocation rules. We show that the\npolytope of jointly feasible interim allocation rules is the projection of a\nhigher dimensional polytope which can be specified by only $O(\\NumTypes^2)$\nlinear constraints. Furthermore, our proof shows that finding a preimage of the\ninterim allocation rules in the higher dimensional polytope immediately gives\nan ex-post implementation.\n","330459":"  A superconductor with a gap in the density of states or a quantum dot with\ndiscrete energy levels is a central building block in realizing an electronic\non-chip cooler. They can work as energy filters, allowing only hot\nquasiparticles to tunnel out from the electrode to be cooled. This principle\nhas been employed experimentally since the early 1990s in investigations and\ndemonstrations of micrometre-scale coolers at sub-kelvin temperatures. In this\npaper, we review the basic experimental conditions in realizing the coolers and\nthe main practical issues that are known to limit their performance. We give an\nupdate of experiments performed on cryogenic micrometre-scale coolers in the\npast five years.\n","330460":"  The human sense of hearing perceives a combination of sounds 'in tune' if the\ncorresponding harmonic spectra are correlated, meaning that the neuronal\nexcitation pattern in the inner ear exhibits some kind of order. Based on this\nobservation it is suggested that musical instruments such as pianos can be\ntuned by minimizing the Shannon entropy of suitably preprocessed Fourier\nspectra. This method reproduces not only the correct stretch curve but also\nsimilar pitch fluctuations as in the case of high-quality aural tuning.\n","330461":"  Context. The HII region\/PDR\/molecular cloud complex S106 is excited by a\nsingle O-star. The full extent of the warm and dense gas close to the star has\nnot been mapped in spectrally resolved high-J CO or [CII] lines, so the\nkinematics of the warm, partially ionized gas, are unknown. Whether the\nprominent dark lane bisecting the hourglass-shaped nebula is due solely to the\nshadow cast by a small disk around the exciting star or also to extinction in\nhigh column foreground gas was an open question until now. Aims. To disentangle\nthe morphology and kinematics of warm neutral and ionized gas close to the\nstar, study their relation to the bulk of the molecular gas, and to investigate\nthe nature of the dark lane. Methods. We use the heterodyne receiver GREAT on\nboard SOFIA to observe velocity resolved spectral lines of [C II] and CO 11-10\nin comparison with so far unpublished submm continuum data at 350 micron\n(SHARC-II) and complementary molecular line data. Results. The high angular and\nspectral resolution observations show a very complex morphology and kinematics\nof the inner S106 region, with many different components at different\nexcitation conditions contributing to the observed emission. The [C II] lines\nare found to be bright and very broad, tracing high velocity gas close to the\ninterface of molecular cloud and HII region. CO 11-10 emission is more\nconfined, both spatially and in velocity, to the immediate surroundings of S106\nIR showing the presence of warm, high density (clumpy) gas. Our high angular\nresolution submm continuum observations rule out the scenario where the dark\nlane separating the two lobes is due solely to the shadow cast by a small disk\nclose to the star. The lane is clearly seen also as warm, high column density\ngas at the boundary of the molecular cloud and HII region.\n","330462":"  We show that the Hilbert space of the standard linear harmonic oscillator is\na complete orbit of the osp(2,1;2) spectrum-generating superalgebra, and that\nthis is the smallest such algebraic structure. The ubiquitous appearance of the\nlinear harmonic oscillator in virtually all domains of theoretical physics\nguarantees a corresponding ubiquity of appropriate generalizations of this\nspectrum-generating superalgebra.\n","330463":"  Traditionally stellar radiation has been the only heat source considered\ncapable of determining global climate on long timescales. Here we show that\nterrestrial exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars may be tidally heated at high\nenough levels to induce a runaway greenhouse for a long enough duration for all\nthe hydrogen to escape. Without hydrogen, the planet no longer has water and\ncannot support life. We call these planets \"Tidal Venuses,\" and the phenomenon\na \"tidal greenhouse.\" Tidal effects also circularize the orbit, which decreases\ntidal heating. Hence, some planets may form with large eccentricity, with its\naccompanying large tidal heating, and lose their water, but eventually settle\ninto nearly circular orbits (i.e. with negligible tidal heating) in the\nhabitable zone (HZ). However, these planets are not habitable as past tidal\nheating desiccated them, and hence should not be ranked highly for detailed\nfollow-up observations aimed at detecting biosignatures. Planets orbiting stars\nwith masses <0.3 solar masses may be in danger of desiccation via tidal\nheating. We apply these concepts to Gl 667C c, a ~4.5 Earth-mass planet\norbiting a 0.3 solar mass star at 0.12 AU. We find that it probably did not\nlose its water via tidal heating as orbital stability is unlikely for the high\neccentricities required for the tidal greenhouse. As the inner edge of the HZ\nis defined by the onset of a runaway or moist greenhouse powered by radiation,\nour results represent a fundamental revision to the HZ for non-circular orbits.\nIn the appendices we review a) the moist and runaway greenhouses, b) hydrogen\nescape, c) stellar mass-radius and mass-luminosity relations, d) terrestrial\nplanet mass-radius relations, and e) linear tidal theories.

This survey has recently benefited\nfrom an accurate calibration of the redshift distribution, allowing new\nmeasurements of the (non-linear) matter power spectrum in a unique range of\nscales and redshifts sensitive to neutrino free streaming. Our analysis makes\nuse of a recent model for the effect of neutrinos on the weakly non-linear\nmatter power spectrum derived from accurate N-body simulations. We show that\nCFHTLS, combined with WMAP7 and a prior on the Hubble constant provides an\nupper limit of $\\sum{m_\\nu}<0.29\\,$eV and $N_{\\rm{eff}} =4.17^{+1.62}_{-1.26}$\n(2$\\,\\sigma$ confidence levels). If we omit smaller scales which may be\naffected by non-linearities, these constraints become $\\sum{m_\\nu}<0.41\\,$eV\nand $N_{\\rm{eff}} =3.98^{+2.02}_{-1.20}$ (2$\\,\\sigma$ confidence levels).\nFinally we show that the addition of other large scale structures probes can\nfurther improve these constraints, demonstrating that high redshift large\nvolumes surveys such as CFHTLS are complementary to other cosmological probes\nof the neutrino mass.\n","330465":"  Recent LHC results suggest a standard model (SM)-like Higgs boson in the\nvicinity of 125 GeV with no clear indications yet of physics beyond the SM. At\nthe same time, the SM is incomplete, since additional dynamics are required to\naccommodate cosmological dark matter (DM). In this paper we show that\ninteractions between weak scale DM and the Higgs which are strong enough to\nyield a thermal relic abundance consistent with observation can easily\ndestabilize the electroweak vacuum or drive the theory into a non-perturbative\nregime at a low scale. As a consequence, new physics--beyond the DM\nitself--must enter at a cutoff well below the Planck scale and in some cases as\nlow as O(10 - 1000 TeV), a range relevant to indirect probes of flavor and CP\nviolation. In addition, this cutoff is correlated with the DM mass and\nscattering cross-section in a parameter space which will be probed\nexperimentally in the near term. Specifically, we consider the SM plus\nadditional spin 0 or 1\/2 states with singlet, triplet, or doublet electroweak\nquantum numbers and quartic or Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson. We derive\nexplicit expressions for the full two-loop RGEs and one-loop threshold\ncorrections for these theories.\n","330466":"  We study the Borcherds superalgebra obtained by adding an odd (fermionic)\nnull root to the set of simple roots of a simple finite-dimensional Lie\nalgebra. We compare it to the Kac-Moody algebra obtained by replacing the odd\nnull root by an ordinary simple root, and then adding more simple roots, such\nthat each node that we add to the Dynkin diagram is connected to the previous\none with a single line. This generalizes the situation in maximal supergravity,\nwhere the E(n) symmetry algebra can be extended to either a Borcherds\nsuperalgebra or to the Kac-Moody algebra E(11), and both extensions can be used\nto derive the spectrum of p-form potentials in the theory. We show that also in\nthe general case, the Borcherds and Kac-Moody extensions lead to the same\np-form spectrum of representations of the simple finite-dimensional Lie\nalgebra.\n","330467":"  We report the experimental realization of an optical trap that localizes\nsingle Cs atoms ~215 nm from surface of a dielectric nanofiber.

Using the outputs of the Starburst99 code, we compare the\npopulations' integrated properties, including ionizing radiation fields,\nbolometric luminosities, and colors. With these comparisons we are able to\nprobe the specific effects of rotation on the properties of a stellar\npopulation. We find that a population of rotating stars produces a much harder\nionizing radiation field and a higher bolometric luminosity, changes that are\nprimarily attributable to the effects of rotational mixing on the lifetimes,\nluminosities, effective temperatures, and mass loss rates of massive stars. We\nconsider the implications of the profound effects that rotation can have on a\nstellar population, and discuss the importance of refining stellar evolutionary\nmodels for future work in the study of extragalactic, and particularly\nhigh-redshift, stellar populations.\n","330469":"  In this paper we perform a detailed analysis of the effect of various\napproximations which have been used in the literature to compute the detection\nrates of compact binary coalescences for interferometric gravitational wave\ndetectors. We evaluate the detection rates for the coalescence of BH-BH, NS-NS,\nand BH-NS binaries taking into account their specific statistical properties\nobtained from population synthesis models, the cosmic star formation rate\nhistory, and the effects of redshift on the emitted gravitational wave signals.\nThe results are compared with those obtained with procedures that are based on\ndifferent levels of approximations, such as adopting averaged values for the\ntotal mass and symmetric mass ratio for all the systems of a binary population,\nusing these to compute the horizon distance for individual detectors, or\nestimating the coalescence rate density within this distance by its local\nvalue.

We use them to\nmap in a systematic way the universe and its constituents, and to discover new\ntypes of objects or phenomena. We review the subject, with an emphasis on the\nwide-field imaging surveys, placing them in a broader scientific and historical\ncontext. Surveys are the largest data generators in astronomy, propelled by the\nadvances in information and computation technology, and have transformed the\nways in which astronomy is done. We describe the variety and the general\nproperties of surveys, the ways in which they may be quantified and compared,\nand offer some figures of merit that can be used to compare their scientific\ndiscovery potential. Surveys enable a very wide range of science; that is\nperhaps their key unifying characteristic. As new domains of the observable\nparameter space open up thanks to the advances in technology, surveys are often\nthe initial step in their exploration. Science can be done with the survey data\nalone or a combination of different surveys, or with a targeted follow-up of\npotentially interesting selected sources. Surveys can be used to generate\nlarge, statistical samples of objects that can be studied as populations, or as\ntracers of larger structures. They can be also used to discover or generate\nsamples of rare or unusual objects, and may lead to discoveries of some\npreviously unknown types. We discuss a general framework of parameter spaces\nthat can be used for an assessment and comparison of different surveys, and the\nstrategies for their scientific exploration. As we move into the Petascale\nregime, an effective processing and scientific exploitation of such large data\nsets and data streams poses many challenges, some of which may be addressed in\nthe framework of Virtual Observatory and Astroinformatics, with a broader\napplication of data mining and knowledge discovery technologies.\n","330471":"  We present a method to systematically locate and extract capacitive and\ninductive losses in superconducting resonators at microwave frequencies by use\nof mixed-material, lumped element devices. In these devices, ultra-low loss\ntitanium nitride was progressively replaced with aluminum in the\ninter-digitated capacitor and meandered inductor elements. By measuring the\npower dependent loss at 50 mK as the Al-TiN fraction in each element is\nincreased, we find that at low electric field, i.e. in the single photon limit,\nthe loss is two level system in nature and is correlated with the amount of Al\ncapacitance rather than the Al inductance. In the high electric field limit,\nthe remaining loss is linearly related to the product of the Al area times its\ninductance and is likely due to quasiparticles generated by stray radiation. At\nelevated temperature, additional loss is correlated with the amount of Al in\nthe inductance, with a power independent TiN-Al interface loss term that\nexponentially decreases as the temperature is reduced. The TiN-Al interface\nloss is vanishingly small at the 50 mK base temperature.\n","330472":"  Launched on June 11, 2008, the LAT instrument onboard the $Fermi$ Gamma-ray\nSpace Telescope has provided a rare opportunity to study high energy photon\nemission from gamma-ray bursts. Although the majority of such events (27) have\nbeen iden tified by the Fermi LAT Collaboration, four were uncovered by using\nmore sensiti ve statistical techniques (Akerlof et al 2010, Akerlof et al 2011,\nZheng et al 2 012). In this paper, we continue our earlier work by finding\nthree more GRBs ass ociated with high energy photon emission, GRB 110709A,\n111117A and 120107A. To s ystematize our matched filter approach, a pipeline\nhas been developed to identif y these objects in near real time. GRB 120107A is\nthe first product of this anal ysis procedure. Despite the reduced threshold\nfor identification, the number of GRB events has not increased significantly.\nThis relative dearth of events with low photon number prompted a study of the\napparent photon number distribution. W e find an extremely good fit to a simple\npower-law with an exponent of -1.8 $\\pm $ 0.3 for the differential\ndistribution. As might be expected, there is a substa ntial correlation between\nthe number of lower energy photons detected by the GBM and the number observed\nby the LAT. Thus, high energy photon emission is associ ated with some but not\nall of the brighter GBM events.

Extraction of standard pair-breaking parameters puts a\nlimit of \\sim26 K on the maximum Tc for all transition metal-substituted 122\nsystems, in agreement with experimental observations, and sets a critical\nscattering rate of 1.5x10^14 s^-1 for the suppression of the superconducting\nphase. The observed critical scattering rate is much weaker than that expected\nfor a sign-changing order parameter, providing important constraints on the\nnature of the superconducting gap in the 122 family of iron-based\nsuperconductors.\n","330474":"  The quantitative study of the physical properties and chemical abundances of\nlarge samples of massive blue stars at different metallicities is a powerful\ntool to understand the nature and evolution of these objects. Their analysis\nbeyond the Milky Way is challenging, nonetheless it is doable and the best way\nto investigate their behavior in different environments. Fulfilling this task\nin an objective way requires the implementation of automatic analysis\ntechniques that can perform the analyses systematically, minimizing at the same\ntime any possible bias.\n  As part of the ARAUCARIA project we carry out the first quantitative\nspectroscopic analysis of a sample of 12 B-type supergiants in the galaxy NGC55\nat 1.94 Mpc away. By applying the methodology developed in this work, we derive\ntheir stellar parameters, chemical abundances and provide a characterization of\nthe present-day metallicity of their host galaxy.\n  Based on the characteristics of the stellar atmosphere\/line formation code\nFASTWIND, we designed and created a grid of models for the analysis of massive\nblue supergiant stars. Along with this new grid, we implemented a spectral\nanalysis algorithm. Both tools were specially developed to perform fully\nconsistent quantitative spectroscopic analyses of low spectral resolution of\nB-type supergiants in a fast and objective way.\n  We present the main characteristics of our FASTWIND model grid and perform a\nnumber of tests to investigate the reliability of our methodology. The\nautomatic tool is applied afterward to a sample of 12 B-type supergiant stars\nin NGC55, deriving the stellar parameters and abundances. The results indicate\nthat our stars are part of a young population evolving towards a red supergiant\nphase. The derived chemical composition hints to an average metallicity similar\nto the one of the Large Magellanic Cloud, with no indication of a spatial trend\nacross the galaxy.\n","330475":"  We demonstrate that the Renyi-2 entropy provides a natural measure of\ninformation for any multimode Gaussian state of quantum harmonic systems,\noperationally linked to the phase-space Shannon sampling entropy of the Wigner\ndistribution of the state. We prove that, in the Gaussian scenario, such an\nentropy satisfies the strong subadditivity inequality, a key requirement for\nquantum information theory. This allows us to define and analyze measures of\nGaussian entanglement and more general quantum correlations based on such an\nentropy, which are shown to satisfy relevant properties such as monogamy.\n","330476":"  Due to the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies,\nunderstanding the mechanisms that trigger active galactic nuclei (AGN) are\nimperative to understanding galaxy evolution and the formation of massive\ngalaxies. It is observationally difficult to determine the trigger of a given\nAGN due to the difference between the AGN lifetime and triggering timescales.\nHere, we utilize AGN population synthesis modeling to determine the importance\nof different AGN triggering mechanisms. An AGN population model is computed by\ncombining an observationally motivated AGN triggering rate and a theoretical\nAGN light curve. The free parameters of the AGN light curve are constrained by\nminimizing a \\chi squared test with respect to the observed AGN hard X-ray\nluminosity function. The observed black hole space density, AGN number counts,\nand X-ray background spectrum are also considered as observational constraints.\nIt is found that major mergers are not able to account for the entire AGN\npopulation. Therefore, non-merger processes, such as secular mechanisms, must\nalso trigger AGN. Indeed, non-merger processes are the dominant AGN triggering\nmechanism at z \\lesssim 1--1.5. Furthermore, the shape and evolution of the\nblack hole mass function of AGN triggered by major mergers is intrinsically\ndifferent from the shape and evolution of the black hole mass function of AGN\ntriggered by secular processes.\n","330477":"  Using analytical techniques and Langevin dynamics simulations, we investigate\nthe dynamics of polymer translocation through a nanochannel embedded in two\ndimensions under an applied external field.

For\nshort channels $L\\ll N$, the translocation time $\\tau \\sim N^{1+\\nu}$ under\nweak driving force $F$, while $\\tau\\sim F^{-1}L$ for long channels $L\\gg N$,\nindependent of the chain length $N$. Moreover, we observe a minimum of\ntranslocation time as a function of $L\/N$ for different driving forces and\nchannel widths. These results are interpreted by the waiting time of a single\nsegment.\n","330478":"  In this article we explore the origin of black hole thermodynamics using\nsemiclassical states in loop quantum gravity. We re-examine the case of entropy\nusing a density matrix for a coherent state and describe correlations across\nthe horizon due to SU(2) intertwiners.

At a fixed\nchemical potential, reducing the anisotropy (or equivalently increasing the\nattractive interactions or increasing the magnetic field) leads to\ninstabilities towards pair density waves, and vortex lattices. Reducing the\nchemical potential stabilizes the system. We calculate the phase diagram, and\nexplore the density and pair density. The structures are similar to those\npredicted for superfluid Bose gases. We further calculate the paired fraction,\nshowing how it depends on chemical potential and anisotropy.\n","330480":"  We give a method to prove confluence of term rewriting systems that contain\nnon-terminating rewrite rules such as commutativity and associativity. Usually,\nconfluence of term rewriting systems containing such rules is proved by\ntreating them as equational term rewriting systems and considering E-critical\npairs and\/or termination modulo E. In contrast, our method is based solely on\nusual critical pairs and it also (partially) works even if the system is not\nterminating modulo E. We first present confluence criteria for term rewriting\nsystems whose rewrite rules can be partitioned into a terminating part and a\npossibly non-terminating part. We then give a reduction-preserving completion\nprocedure so that the applicability of the criteria is enhanced. In contrast to\nthe well-known Knuth-Bendix completion procedure which preserves the\nequivalence relation of the system, our completion procedure preserves the\nreduction relation of the system, by which confluence of the original system is\ninferred from that of the completed system.\n","330481":"  The superconducting pairing instability---as determined by a divergence of\nthe two-particle susceptibility---is obtained in the mean field (BCS)\napproximation in the thermodynamic limit. The usual practice is to examine this\nproperty for a finite lattice. We illustrate that, while the conclusions remain\nunchanged, the technical features are very different in the thermodynamic limit\nand conform more closely with the usual treatment of phase transitions\nencountered in, for example, the mean-field paramagnetic-ferromagnetic\ntransition. Furthermore, by going to the extreme dilute limit, one can\ndistinguish three dimensions from one and two dimensions, in which a pairing\ninstability occurs even for two particles.\n","330482":"  Homotopy perturbation is one of the newest methods for numerical analysis of\ndeferential equations.

While\nbilinear random effect models (matrix factorization) provide state-of-the-art\nperformance when minimizing RMSE through a Gaussian response model on explicit\nratings data, applying it to imbalanced binary response data presents\nadditional challenges that we carefully study in this paper. Data in many\napplications usually consist of users' implicit response that are often binary\n-- clicking an item or not; the goal is to predict click rates, which is often\ncombined with other measures to calculate utilities to rank items at runtime of\nthe recommender systems. Because of the implicit nature, such data are usually\nmuch larger than explicit rating data and often have an imbalanced distribution\nwith a small fraction of click events, making accurate click rate prediction\ndifficult. In this paper, we address two problems. First, we show previous\ntechniques to estimate bilinear random effect models with binary data are less\naccurate compared to our new approach based on adaptive rejection sampling,\nespecially for imbalanced response. Second, we develop a parallel bilinear\nrandom effect model fitting framework using Map-Reduce paradigm that scales to\nmassive datasets. Our parallel algorithm is based on a \"divide and conquer\"\nstrategy coupled with an ensemble approach. Through experiments on the\nbenchmark MovieLens data, a small Yahoo! Front Page data set, and a large\nYahoo! Front Page data set that contains 8M users and 1B binary observations,\nwe show that careful handling of binary response as well as identifiability\nissues are needed to achieve good performance for click rate prediction, and\nthat the proposed adaptive rejection sampler and the partitioning as well as\nensemble techniques significantly improve model performance.\n","330484":"  Current constraints on f(R) gravity from the large-scale structure are at the\nverge of penetrating into a region where the modified forces become nonlinearly\nsuppressed. For a consistent treatment of observables at these scales, we study\ncluster quantities produced in chameleon and linearized Hu-Sawicki f(R) gravity\ndark matter N-body simulations. We find that the standard Navarro-Frenk-White\nhalo density profile and the radial power law for the pseudo phase-space\ndensity provide equally good fits for f(R) clusters as they do in the Newtonian\nscenario. We give qualitative arguments for why this should be the case. For\npractical applications, we derive analytic relations, e.g., for the f(R) scalar\nfield, the gravitational potential, and the velocity dispersion as seen within\nthe virialized clusters. These functions are based on three degrees of freedom\nfitted to simulations, i.e., the characteristic density, scale, and velocity\ndispersion. We further analyze predictions for these fitting parameters from\nthe gravitational collapse and the Jeans equation, which are found to agree\nwell with the simulations. Our analytic results can be used to consistently\nconstrain chameleon f(R) gravity with future observations on virialized cluster\nscales without the necessity of running a large number of simulations.\n","330485":"  Temporal communities result from a consistent partitioning of nodes across\nmultiple snapshots of an evolving complex network that can help uncover how\ndense clusters in a network emerge, combine, split and decay with time. Current\nmethods for finding communities in a single snapshot are not straightforwardly\ngeneralizable to finding temporal communities since the quality functions used\nfor finding static communities have highly degenerate landscapes, and the\neventual partition chosen among the many partitions of similar quality is\nhighly sensitive to small changes in the network. To reliably detect temporal\ncommunities we need not only to find a good community partition in a given\nsnapshot but also ensure that it bears some similarity to the partition(s)\nfound in immediately preceding snapshots. We present a new measure of partition\ndistance called \"estrangement\" motivated by the inertia of inter-node\nrelationships which, when incorporated into the measurement of partition\nquality, facilitates the detection of meaningful temporal communities.\nSpecifically, we propose the estrangement confinement method, which postulates\nthat neighboring nodes in a community prefer to continue to share community\naffiliation as the network evolves. Constraining estrangement enables us to\nfind meaningful temporal communities at various degrees of temporal smoothness\nin diverse real-world datasets. Specifically, we study the evolution of voting\nbehavior of senators in the United States Congress, the evolution of proximity\nin human mobility datasets, and the detection of evolving communities in\nsynthetic networks that are otherwise hard to find. Estrangement confinement\nthus provides a principled approach to uncovering temporal communities in\nevolving networks.\n","330486":"  We review the main ideas of arXiv:1106.4015: A change of field variables in\nthe NSNS Lagrangian of ten-dimensional supergravity reveals the non-geometric\nQ-flux expressed in terms of an antisymmetric bivector field.

A fast implementation of the bilateral filter was recently proposed in\n[2] that required O(1) operations per pixel with respect to \\sigma_s. This was\ndone by using trigonometric functions for the range kernel of the bilateral\nfilter, and by exploiting their so-called shiftability property. In particular,\na fast implementation of the Gaussian bilateral filter was realized by\napproximating the Gaussian range kernel using raised cosines. Later, it was\ndemonstrated in [3] that this idea could be extended to a larger class of\nfilters, including the popular non-local means filter [4]. As already observed\nin [2], a flip side of this approach was that the run time depended on the\nwidth \\sigma_r of the range kernel. For an image with (local) intensity\nvariations in the range [0,T], the run time scaled as O(T^2\/\\sigma^2_r) with\n\\sigma_r. This made it difficult to implement narrow range kernels,\nparticularly for images with large dynamic range. We discuss this problem in\nthis note, and propose some simple steps to accelerate the implementation in\ngeneral, and for small \\sigma_r in particular.\n  [1] C. Tomasi and R.

It is known that when energy is injected into the fluid at an\nintermediate scale $L_f$, it cascades towards smaller as well as larger scales.\nIn this paper we analyze the flow in the \\textit{inverse cascade} range at a\nsmall but fixed Rossby number, {$\\mathcal{R}o_f \\approx 0.05$}. Several\n{numerical simulations with} helical and non-helical forcing functions are\nconsidered in periodic boxes with unit aspect ratio. In order to resolve the\ninverse cascade range with {reasonably} large Reynolds number, the analysis is\nbased on large eddy simulations which include the effect of helicity on eddy\nviscosity and eddy noise. Thus, we model the small scales and resolve\nexplicitly the large scales. We show that the large-scale energy spectrum has\nat least two solutions: one that is consistent with\nKolmogorov-Kraichnan-Batchelor-Leith phenomenology for the inverse cascade of\nenergy in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence with a {$\\sim k_{\\perp}^{-5\/3}$}\nscaling, and the other that corresponds to a steeper {$\\sim k_{\\perp}^{-3}$}\nspectrum in which the three-dimensional (3D) modes release a substantial\nfraction of their energy per unit time to 2D modes. {The spectrum that} emerges\n{depends on} the anisotropy of the forcing function{,} the former solution\nprevailing for forcings in which more energy is injected into 2D modes while\nthe latter prevails for isotropic forcing. {In the case of anisotropic forcing,\nwhence the energy} goes from the 2D to the 3D modes at low wavenumbers,\nlarge-scale shear is created resulting in another time scale $\\tau_{sh}$,\nassociated with shear, {thereby producing} a $\\sim k^{-1}$ spectrum for the\n{total energy} with the 2D modes still following a {$\\sim k_{\\perp}^{-5\/3}$}\nscaling.\n","330491":"  Infinite, neutron-proton symmetric, neutral nuclear matter has a critical\ntemperature of 17.9+-0.4 MeV, a critical density of 0.06+-0.01 nucleons per\ncubic fermi and a critical pressure of 0.31+-0.07 MeV per cubic fermi.

This unconstrained\noptimization approach can be used to find a Z-, H-, or D-eigenvalue of an even\norder weakly symmetric tensor. We provide some numerical results to illustrate\nthe effectiveness of this approach for finding a Z-eigenvalue and for\ndetermining the positive semidefiniteness of an even order symmetric tensor.\n","330510":"  We investigate the role of convection on its large time behavior of 3D\nincompressible Euler equations. In \\cite{HL09a}, we constructed a new 3D model\nby neglecting the convection term from the reformulated axisymmetric\nNavier-Stokes equations. This model preserves almost all the properties of the\nfull Navier-Stokes equations, including an energy identity for smooth\nsolutions. The numerical evidence presented in \\cite{HL09a} seems to support\nthat the 3D model may develop a finite time singularity. In this paper, we\nprove rigorously that the 3D inviscid model develops a finite time singularity\nfor a family of smooth initial data whose energy is finite and conserved in\ntime.\n","330511":"  We consider (2+1)-dimensional (N, M)-extended higher-spin anti-de Sitter\nsupergravity and study its asymptotic symmetries. The theory is described by\nthe Chern-Simons action based on a real, infinite-dimensional higher-spin\nsuperalgebra. We specify consistent boundary conditions on the higher-spin\nsuper-gauge connection corresponding to asymptotically anti-de Sitter\nspacetimes. We then determine the residual gauge transformations that preserve\nthese asymptotic conditions and compute their Poisson bracket algebra. We find\nthat the asymptotic symmetry is enhanced from the higher-spin superalgebra to\nsome (N,M)-extended super-W(infinity) nonlinear superalgebra. The latter has\nthe same classical central charge as pure Einstein gravity. Special attention\nis paid to the (1,1)-case. Truncation to the bosonic sector yields the\npreviously found W(infinity) algebra, while truncation to the underlying\nfinite-dimensional superalgebra reproduces the N-extended superconformal\nalgebra (in its nonlinear version for N>2). We discuss string theory\nrealization of these higher-spin anti-de Sitter supergravity theories as well\nas relations to previous treatments of super-W(infinity) in the literature.\n","330512":"  In effective field theories it is common to identify the onset of new physics\nwith the violation of tree-level unitarity. However, we show that this is\nparametrically incorrect in the case of chiral perturbation theory, and is\nprobably theoretically incorrect in general. In the chiral theory, we explore\nperturbative unitarity violation as a function of the number of colors and the\nnumber of flavors, holding the scale of the \"new physics\" (i.e. QCD) fixed.\nThis demonstrates that the onset of new physics is parametrically uncorrelated\nwith tree-unitarity violation. When the latter scale is lower than that of new\nphysics, the effective theory must heal its unitarity violation itself, which\nis expected because the field theory satisfies the requirements of unitarity.\nIn the chiral theory, the self-healing results in a resonant structure with\nscalar quantum numbers. In the electroweak variant of this argument, the\nstructure must have the properties of the Higgs and must couple proportional to\nthe mass in both gauge boson and fermion scattering. A similar example can be\nseen in the case of general relativity coupled to multiple matter fields, where\niteration of the vacuum polarization diagram restores unitarity. We present\narguments that suggest the correct identification should be connected to the\nonset of inelasticity rather than unitarity violation. We describe how the\nonset of inelasticity can occur in the effective theory, although it does not\nappear possible to predict the onset reliably.\n","330513":"  We present the emission line profile models of hydrogen and helium based on\nthe results from axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of the\nwind formed near the disk-magnetosphere boundary of classical T Tauri stars\n(CTTSs). We extend the previous outflow models of `the conical-shell wind' by\nRomanova et al. to include a well defined magnetospheric accretion funnel flow\nwhich is essential for modelling the optical and near-infrared hydrogen and\nhelium lines of CTTSs. The MHD model with an intermediate mass-accretion rate\nshows outflows in conical-shell shape with a half opening angle about 35\ndegrees. The flow properties such as the maximum outflow speed in the\nconical-shell wind, maximum inflow speed in the accretion funnel,\nmass-accretion and mass-loss rates are comparable to those found in a typical\nCTTS. The density, velocity and modified temperature from the MHD simulations\nare used in a separate radiative transfer model to predict the line profiles\nand test the consistency of the MHD models with observations. The line profiles\nare computed with various combinations of X-ray luminosities, temperatures of\nX-ray emitting plasma, and inclination angles. A rich diversity of line profile\nmorphology is found, and many of the model profiles are very similar to those\nfound in observations. We find that the conical-shell wind may contribute to\nthe emission in some hydrogen lines (e.g. H-alpha, H-beta, Pa-beta and\nPa-gamma) significantly when the temperature in the wind is relatively high\n(e.g. \\sim 10^{4} K); however, the wind contribution decreases rapidly when a\nlower wind temperature is adopted. The model well reproduces a relatively\nnarrow and low-velocity blueshifted absorption component in He I (10830), which\nare often seen in observations.\n","330514":"  We consider a general class of Bayesian Games where each players utility\ndepends on his type (possibly multidimensional) and on the strategy profile and\nwhere players' types are distributed independently. We show that if their full\ninformation version for any fixed instance of the type profile is a smooth game\nthen the Price of Anarchy bound implied by the smoothness property, carries\nover to the Bayes-Nash Price of Anarchy. We show how some proofs from the\nliterature (item bidding auctions, greedy auctions) can be cast as smoothness\nproofs or be simplified using smoothness. For first price item bidding with\nfractionally subadditive bidders we actually manage to improve by much the\nexisting result \\cite{Hassidim2011a} from 4 to $\\frac{e}{e-1}\\approx 1.58$.\nThis also shows a very interesting separation between first and second price\nitem bidding since second price item bidding has PoA at least 2 even under\ncomplete information. For a larger class of Bayesian Games where the strategy\nspace of a player also changes with his type we are able to show that a\nslightly stronger definition of smoothness also implies a Bayes-Nash PoA bound.\nWe show how weighted congestion games actually satisfy this stronger definition\nof smoothness. This allows us to show that the inefficiency bounds of weighted\ncongestion games known in the literature carry over to incomplete versions\nwhere the weights of the players are private information. We also show how an\nincomplete version of a natural class of monotone valid utility games, called\neffort market games are universally $(1,1)$-smooth. Hence, we show that\nincomplete versions of effort market games where the abilities of the players\nand their budgets are private information has Bayes-Nash PoA at most 2.\n","330515":"  In this paper, a new peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction scheme for\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is proposed based on the\nselected mapping (SLM) scheme. The proposed SLM scheme generates alternative\nOFDM signal sequences by cyclically shifting the connections in each subblock\nat an intermediate stage of inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). Compared\nwith the conventional SLM scheme, the proposed SLM scheme achieves similar PAPR\nreduction performance with much lower computational complexity and no bit error\nrate (BER) degradation. The performance of the proposed SLM scheme is verified\nthrough numerical analysis.

Rather than modeling the network\ncumulatively, this study traces the evolution of the \"here and now\" using\nfixed-duration sliding windows. The analysis uses a suite of common network\ndiagnostics, including the distributions of degrees, distances, and clustering,\nto track network structure. Several random models that call these diagnostics\nas parameters help tease them apart as factors from the values of others. Some\nbehaviors are consistent over the entire interval, but most diagnostics\nindicate that the network's structural evolution is dominated by occasional\ndramatic shifts in otherwise steady trends. These behaviors are not distributed\nevenly across the network; stark differences in evolution can be observed\nbetween two major subnetworks, loosely thought of as \"pure\" and \"applied\",\nwhich approximately partition the aggregate.

We find a large region in the phase diagram, where an\norbital selective Mott phase will be stabilized by the positive crystal field\nlifting the orbital degeneracy. Further analysis indicates that the Hund's rule\ncoupling is essential for the orbital selective Mott phase and the transition\ntoward this phase is accompanied by a high-spin to low-spin transition.

As many other supersymmetries, Q-symmetry must be perturbatively\nstable due to what is generically known as non-renormalization theorems. As a\nresult, all (equilibrium) dynamical models are divided into three major\ncategories: Markovian models with unbroken Q-symmetry, chaotic models with\nQ-symmetry spontaneously broken on the mean-field level by, e.g., fractal\ninvariant sets (e.g., strange attractors), and intermittent or self-organized\ncritical (SOC) models with Q-symmetry dynamically broken by the condensation of\ninstanton-antiinstanton configurations (earthquakes, avalanches etc.) SOC is a\nfull-dimensional phase separating chaos and Markovian dynamics. In the\ndeterministic limit, however, antiinstantons disappear and SOC collapses into\nthe \"edge of chaos\". Goldstone theorem stands behind spatio-temporal\nself-similarity of Q-broken phases known under such names as algebraic\nstatistics of avalanches, 1\/f noise, sensitivity to initial conditions etc.\nOther fundamental differences of Q-broken phases is that they can be\neffectively viewed as quantum dynamics and that they must also have\ntime-reversal symmetry spontaneously broken.

This also makes it possible to uniformly treat all events observed\non a sample path of a stochastic hybrid system and generalize the performance\nsensitivity estimators derived through Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis\n(IPA). We eliminate the need for a case-by-case treatment of different event\ntypes and provide a unified set of matrix IPA equations.

We study transition to chaos by tracking\nvariations in spectral statistics with increasing length of the segment.\nAnalysis of the FREO is accompanied with ray calculations using the one-step\nPoincar\\'e map which is the classical counterpart of the FREO. Underwater sound\nchannel in the Sea of Japan is taken for an example. Several methods of\nspectral analysis are utilized. In particular, we approximate level spacing\nstatistics by means of the Berry-Robnik and Brody distributions, explore the\nspectrum using the procedure elaborated by A. Relano with coworkers (Relano et\nal, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2002; Relano, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2008), and analyze modal\nexpansions of the eigenfunctions. We show that the analysis of FREO\neigenfunctions is more informative than the analysis of eigenvalue statistics.\nIt is found that near-axial sound propagation in the Sea of Japan preserves\nstability even over distances of hundreds kilometers. This phenomenon is\nassociated with the presence of a shearless torus in the classical phase space.\nIncreasing of acoustic wavelength degrades scattering, resulting in recovery of\nlocalization near periodic orbits of the one-step Poincar\\'e map.

Given prescribed\nmixture weights, the hard clustering $k$-MLE algorithm iteratively assigns data\nto the most likely weighted component and update the component models using\nMaximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs). Using the duality between exponential\nfamilies and Bregman divergences, we prove that the local convergence of the\ncomplete likelihood of $k$-MLE follows directly from the convergence of a dual\nadditively weighted Bregman hard clustering.

The\nresults are given illustrating the complexity of the underlying process.\n","330545":"  Proper edge coloring of a graph $G$ is called acyclic if there is no\nbichromatic cycle in $G$. The acyclic chromatic index of $G$, denoted by\n$\\chi'_a(G)$, is the least number of colors $k$ such that $G$ has an acyclic\nedge $k$-coloring. Basavaraju et al. [Acyclic edge-coloring of planar graphs,\nSIAM J. Discrete Math. 25 (2) (2011), 463--478] showed that $\\chi'_a(G)\\le\n\\Delta(G)+12$ for planar graphs $G$ with maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$. In this\npaper, the bound is improved to $\\Delta(G)+10$.\n","330546":"  In this paper we investigate the issue of the inviscid limit for the\ncompressible Navier-Stokes system in an impermeable fixed bounded domain. We\nconsider two kinds of boundary conditions. The first one is the no-slip\ncondition. In this case we extend the famous conditional result obtained by\nKato in the homogeneous incompressible case. Kato proved that if the energy\ndissipation rate of the viscous flow in a boundary layer of width proportional\nto the viscosity vanishes then the solutions of the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations converge to some solutions of the incompressible Euler\nequations in the energy space. We provide here a natural extension of this\nresult to the compressible case. The other case is the Navier condition which\nencodes that the fluid slips with some friction on the boundary. In this case\nwe show that the convergence to the Euler equations holds true in the energy\nspace, as least when the friction is not too large. In both cases we use in a\ncrucial way some relative energy estimates proved recently by Feireisl, Ja Jin\nand Novotn{\\'y}.\n","330547":"  Frequently asked questions (FAQs) are a popular way to document software\ndevelopment knowledge. As creating such documents is expensive, this paper\npresents an approach for automatically extracting FAQs from sources of software\ndevelopment discussion, such as mailing lists and Internet forums, by combining\ntechniques of text mining and natural language processing. We apply the\napproach to popular mailing lists and carry out a survey among software\ndevelopers to show that it is able to extract high-quality FAQs that may be\nfurther improved by experts.\n","330548":"  We analyse an optimal control with the following features: the dynamical\nsystem is linear, and the dependence upon the control parameter is affine. More\nprecisely we consider $\\dot x_\\alpha(t) = (G + \\alpha(t) F)x_\\alpha(t)$, where\n$G$ and $F$ are $3\\times 3$ matrices with some prescribed structure. In the\ncase of constant control $\\alpha(t)\\equiv \\alpha$, we show the existence of an\noptimal Perron eigenvalue with respect to varying $\\alpha$ under some\nassumptions. Next we investigate the Floquet eigenvalue problem associated to\ntime-periodic controls $\\alpha(t)$. Finally we prove the existence of an\neigenvalue (in the generalized sense) for the optimal control problem. The\nproof is based on the results by [Arisawa 1998, Ann.

Surprisingly enough, the three\neigenvalues appear to be numerically the same.\n","330549":"  We study an anisotropic version of the outer Minkowski content of a closed\nset in Rn.

Both GWs and HENs may escape very dense media and travel\nunaffected over cosmological distances, carrying information from the innermost\nregions of the astrophysical engines. Such messengers could also reveal new,\nhidden sources that have not been observed by conventional photon-based\nastronomy. Coincident observation of GWs and HENs may thus play a critical role\nin multimessenger astronomy. This is particularly true at the present time\nowing to the advent of a new generation of dedicated detectors: IceCube,\nANTARES, VIRGO and LIGO. Given the complexity of the instruments, a successful\njoint analysis of this data set will be possible only if the expertise and\nknowledge of the data is shared between the two communities. This review aims\nat providing an overview of both theoretical and experimental state-of-the-art\nand perspectives for such a GW+HEN multimessenger astronomy.\n","330552":"  We present phi-meson transverse momentum distribution as well as its elliptic\nflow (v_{2}) measurements in Au + Au collisions at center-of-mass energy per\nnucleon pair \\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7, 11.5 and 39 GeV with the data taken from STAR\nexperiment at RHIC in the year 2010. We discuss the energy dependence of\nphi-meson elliptic flow (v_{2}) and central-to-peripheral nuclear modification\nfactors (R_{CP}). The v_{2} of phi-mesons are compared to those from other\nhadron species. The implications on partonic-hadronic phase transition are\ndiscussed.\n","330553":"  We investigate the atmospheric structure and fundamental properties of the\nred supergiant VY CMa. We obtained near-infrared spectro-interferometric\nobservations of VY CMa with spectral resolutions of 35 and 1500 using the AMBER\ninstrument at the VLTI. The visibility data indicate the presence of molecular\nlayers of water vapor and CO in the extended atmosphere with an asymmetric\nmorphology. The uniform disk diameter in the water band around 2.0 mu is\nincreased by \\sim20% compared to the near-continuum bandpass at 2.20-2.25 mu\nand in the CO band at 2.3-2.5 mu it is increased by up to \\sim50%. The closure\nphases indicate relatively small deviations from point symmetry close to the\nphotospheric layer, and stronger deviations in the extended H2O and CO layers.\nMaking use of the high spatial and spectral resolution, a near-continuum\nbandpass can be isolated from contamination by molecular and dusty layers, and\nthe Rosseland-mean photospheric angular diameter is estimated to 11.3 +\/- 0.3\nmas based on a PHOENIX atmosphere model. Together with recent high-precision\nestimates of the distance and spectro-photometry, this estimate corresponds to\na radius of 1420 +\/- 120 Rsun and an effective temperature of 3490 +\/- 90 K. VY\nCMa exhibits asymmetric, possibly clumpy, atmospheric layers of H2O and CO,\nwhich are not co-spatial, within a larger elongated dusty envelope. Our revised\nfundamental parameters put VY CMa close to the Hayashi limit of recent\nevolutionary tracks of initial mass 25 Msun with rotation or 32 Msun without\nrotation, shortly before evolving blueward in the HR-diagram.\n","330554":"  A strong magnetic field applied along the growth direction of a semiconductor\nquantum well gives rise to a spectrum of discrete energy states, the Landau\nlevels. By combining quantum engineering of a quantum cascade structure with a\nstatic magnetic field, we can selectively inject electrons into the excited\nLandau level of a quantum well and realize a tunable surface emitting device\nbased on cyclotron emission.

In parallel, research in academia has been investigating\ntransversal aspects such as security, software frameworks, quality of service,\nand standardization. We believe that the complete realization of the Cloud\ncomputing vision will lead to the introduction of a virtual market where Cloud\nbrokers, on behalf of end users, are in charge of selecting and composing the\nservices advertised by different Cloud vendors. In order to make this happen,\nexisting solutions and technologies have to be redesigned and extended from a\nmarket-oriented perspective and integrated together, giving rise to what we\nterm Market-Oriented Cloud Computing.\n  In this paper, we will assess the current status of Cloud computing by\nproviding a reference model, discuss the challenges that researchers and IT\npractitioners are facing and will encounter in the near future, and present the\napproach for solving them from the perspective of the Cloudbus toolkit, which\ncomprises of a set of technologies geared towards the realization of Market\nOriented Cloud Computing vision. We provide experimental results demonstrating\nmarket-oriented resource provisioning and brokering within a Cloud and across\nmultiple distributed resources.

We propose a new technique for removing foregrounds of the redshifted\n21 cm observations. We consider multi-frequency interferometer observations. We\nassume that the 21 cm signals in different frequency channels are uncorrelated\nand the foreground signals change slowly as a function of frequency. When we\nadd the visibilities of all channels, the foreground signals increase roughly\nby a factor of ~N because they are highly correlated. However, the 21 cm\nsignals increase by a factor of ~\\sqrt{N} because the signals in different\nchannels contribute randomly. This enables us to obtain an accurate shape of\nthe foreground angular power spectrum. Then, we obtain the 21-cm power spectrum\nby subtracting the foreground power spectrum obtained this way. We describe how\nto obtain the average power spectrum of the 21 cm signal.\n","330557":"  In this paper we prove the existence of real-analytic natural Hamiltonian\nsystems - i.e. where H(q,p)=T(q,p)+V(q) in the 2N-dimensional real space, where\nN is any integer greater than 1 - with non critical energy levels E for the\npotential V such that the sublevel E of V is homeomorphic to the N-dimensional\ndisk, and that only one brake orbit of energy E exists. A famous conjecture\nformulated by H. Seifert in 1948 claimed the existence of at least N distinct\nbrake orbits for this situation.\n","330558":"  We study the possible exotic states with $J^{PC} = 0^{+-}$ using the\ntetraquark interpolating currents with the QCD sum rule approach. The extracted\nmasses are around 4.85 GeV for the charmonium-like states and 11.25 GeV for the\nbottomomium-like states. There is no working region for the light tetraquark\ncurrents, which implies the light $0^{+-}$ state may not exist below 2 GeV.\n","330559":"  We extend the Nonconventional Ergodic Theorem for generic measures by\nFurstenberg, to several situations of interest arising from quantum dynamical\nsystems. We deal with the diagonal state canonically associated to the product\nstate (i.e. quantum \"diagonal measures\"), or to convex combinations of diagonal\nmeasures for non ergodic cases. For the sake of completeness, we treat also the\nNonconventional Ergodic Theorem for compact dynamical systems, that is when the\nunitary generating the dynamics in the GNS representation is almost periodic.\nThe Nonconventional Ergodic Theorem allows in a natural way to determine the\nlimit of the three-point correlations, naturally relevant for the knowledge of\nthe ergodic properties of a dynamical system.\n","330560":"  We consider the existence of a continuous set of mutually unbiased bases for\nthe continuous and periodic degree of freedom that describes motion on a circle\n(rotor degree of freedom). By a singular mapping of the circle to the line, we\nfind a first, but somewhat unsatisfactory, continuous set which does not relate\nto an underlying Heisenberg pair of complementary observables. Then, by a\nnonsingular mapping of the discrete angular momentum basis of the rotor onto\nthe Fock basis for linear motion, we construct such a Heisenberg pair for the\nrotor and use it to obtain a second, fully satisfactory, set of mutually\nunbiased bases.\n","330561":"  We present a new model for seed banks, where direct ancestors of individuals\nmay have lived in the near as well as the very far past. The classical\nWright-Fisher model, as well as a seed bank model with bounded age distribution\nconsidered by Kaj, Krone and Lascoux (2001) are special cases of our model. We\ndiscern three parameter regimes of the seed bank age distribution, which lead\nto substantially different behaviour in terms of genetic variability, in\nparticular with respect to fixation of types and time to the most recent common\nancestor. We prove that for age distributions with finite mean, the ancestral\nprocess converges to a time-changed Kingman coalescent, while in the case of\ninfinite mean, ancestral lineages might not merge at all with positive\nprobability. Further, we present a construction of the forward in time process\nin equilibrium. The mathematical methods are based on renewal theory, the urn\nprocess introduced by Kaj et al., as well as on a paper by Hammond and\nSheffield (2011).\n","330562":"  The electron transport in a 1D conductor with an isolated local defect such\nas an impurity or a non-adiabatic contact is studied theoretically. New regime\nof conduction in correlated 1D systems is predicted beyond the well-known\nregime of tunneling resulting in the power-law I-V-curves. In this regime a\nquantum wire becomes \"opened\" at voltage biases above the threshold value\n$V_T$, giving rise to a rapid increase of the dc current, $\\bar I$, accompanied\nby ac oscillations of frequency $f = \\bar I\/e$. The effect of ac generation is\nrelated to sliding of the Friedel oscillations of electronic density produced\nby the defect. Manifestations of the effect resemble the Coulomb blockade and\nthe Josephson effect. The spin bias applied to the system is shown to affect\nthe I-V curves due to violation of the spin-charge separation at the defect\nsite. In short quantum wires of length $L < L_0 \\sim \\hbar v_F\/eV_T$ and at\nhigh temperatures $T > T_0 \\sim eV_T\/k_B$ the effect is destroyed by\nfluctuations. The threshold voltage $V_T$ is determined by $2k_F$-component of\nimpurity potential renormalized by fluctuations. The 1D conductor is described\nin terms of the Tomonaga-Luttinger Hamiltonian with short range or long-range\nCoulomb interaction by means of the bosonization technique. We derive boundary\nconditions that take into account relaxation in the leads and permit to solve\nnon-equilibrium problems. Charge fluctuations are studied by means of Gaussian\nmodel which can be justified strictly in the limit of large voltages or strong\nenough inter-electronic repulsion. Spin fluctuations are taken into account\nstrictly by means of the refermionization technique applicable in case of\nspin-rotation invariant interaction.\n","330563":"  We describe a bound on the degree of the generators for some adjoint rings on\nsurfaces and threefolds.\n","330564":"  When an azobenzene-containing polymer film is exposed to a non-uniform\nillumination, a light-induced mass migration process may be induced, leading to\nthe formation of relief patterns on the polymer free surface. Despite a\nresearch effort of many years and several proposed models many aspects of this\nphenomenon remain not well understood. Here we report the appearance of\nspiral-shaped relief patterns on the polymer under the illumination of focused\nLaguerre-Gauss beams, having helical wavefront and an optical vortex at their\naxis. The induced spiral reliefs are sensitive to the vortex topological charge\nand to the wavefront handedness. These findings are unexpected, because the\n\"doughnut\"-shaped intensity profile of Laguerre- Gauss beams contains no\ninformation about the wavefront handedness. We propose a model that explains\nthe main features of this phenomenon from the surface-mediated interference of\nthe longitudinal and the transverse components of the optical field. These\nresults may find applications in optical micro- and nanolithography and\noptical-field.\n","330565":"  In Bai and Paulsen (SIAM J. Control optim. 48, 2010) the optimal dividend\nproblem under transaction costs was analyzed for a rather general class of\ndiffusion processes.

After transaction costs, the shareholder receives\n$k\\xi-K$.\n  It was proved that a simple barrier strategy is not always optimal, and here\nthese more difficult cases are solved.

Much more information is expected to come in the\nnext few years, from ongoing and planned spectroscopic and astrometric surveys,\nproviding a unique benchmark for modern theories of galaxy formation. In this\nreview, I will summarize recent results on the formation of our Milky Way, its\nstellar halo, and its satellite galaxies.

We find the conditions for positivity and\ncomplete positivity of such dynamical maps by using the concept of an\nassignment map. Any initial system-environment correlations make the assignment\nmap nonpositive, while the positivity of the dynamical map depends on the\ninterplay between the assignment map and the system-environment coupling.

The octonion\npossesses the triality symmetry, which defines symmetry of fermion spinors and\nbosonic vector fields.\n  The triality symmetry relates three sets of spinors and two sets of vectors,\nwhich are transformed among themselves via transformations $G_{23}, G_{12},\nG_{13}$, $G_{123}$ and $G_{132}$. If the electromagnetic (EM) interaction is\nsensitive to the triality symmetry, i.e. EM probe selects one triality sector,\nEM signals from the 5 transformed world would not be detected, and be treated\nas the dark matter. According to an astrophysical measurement, the ratio of the\ndark to ordinary matter in the universe as a whole is almost exactly 5. We\nexpect quarks are insensitive to the triality, and triality will appear as\nthree times larger flavor degrees of freedom in the lattice simulation.\n","330573":"  In models of emergent gravity the metric arises as the expectation value of\nsome collective field. Usually, many different collective fields with\nappropriate tensor properties are candidates for a metric. Which collective\nfield describes the \"physical geometry\"? We resolve this \"metric ambiguity\" by\nan investigation of the most general form of the quantum effective action for\nseveral metrics. In the long-distance limit the physical metric is universal\nand accounts for a massless graviton. Other degrees of freedom contained in the\nvarious metric candidates describe very massive scalars and symmetric second\nrank tensors. They only play a role at microscopic distances, typically around\nthe Planck length. The universality of geometry at long distances extends to\nthe vierbein and the connection. On the other hand, for distances and time\nintervals of Planck size geometry looses its universal meaning.

It is shown that\nWenzel prewetting, which has been recently predicted for a rather wide class of\nroughness profiles derived from Gaussian random processes by a general\ndistortion procedure, should in fact be ubiquitous and prevail under even much\nmilder conditions. The well-known transition occurring at Wenzel's angle is\naccompanied by a prewetting transition, at which a jump in the adsorbed liquid\nvolume occurs. This should be present on most surfaces bearing homogeneous,\nisotropic random roughness.\n","330575":"  A mixture of hard-sphere particles and model emulsion droplets is studied\nwith a Brownian dynamics simulation. We find that the addition of nonwetting\nemulsion droplets to a suspension of pure hard spheres can lead to both\ngas-liquid and fluid-solid phase separations. Furthermore, we find a stable\nfluid of hard-sphere clusters. The stability is due to the saturation of the\nattraction that occurs when the surface of the droplets is completely covered\nwith colloidal particles. At larger emulsion droplet densities a percolation\ntransition is observed. The resulting networks of colloidal particles show\ndynamical and mechanical properties typical of a colloidal gel.

A desirable property for any BQC protocol is\nverification, whereby the client can verify with high probability whether the\nserver has followed the instructions of the protocol, or if there has been some\ndeviation resulting in a corrupted output state. A verifiable BQC protocol can\nbe viewed as an interactive proof system leading to consequences for complexity\ntheory. The authors, together with Broadbent, previously proposed a universal\nand unconditionally secure BQC scheme where the client only needs to be able to\nprepare single qubits in separable states randomly chosen from a finite set and\nsend them to the server, who has the balance of the required quantum\ncomputational resources. In this paper we extend that protocol with new\nfunctionality allowing blind computational basis measurements, which we use to\nconstruct a new verifiable BQC protocol based on a new class of resource\nstates. We rigorously prove that the probability of failing to detect an\nincorrect output is exponentially small in a security parameter, while resource\noverhead remains polynomial in this parameter. The new resource state allows\nentangling gates to be performed between arbitrary pairs of logical qubits with\nonly constant overhead. This is a significant improvement on the original\nscheme, which required that all computations to be performed must first be put\ninto a nearest neighbour form, incurring linear overhead in the number of\nqubits. Such an improvement has important consequences for efficiency and\nfault-tolerance thresholds.\n","330577":"  In the analysis of social networks many relatively loose and heuristic\ndefinitions of 'community' abound.

The\nsolution of equation of motion for actions of the form of power law in Ricci\nscalar R, is presented with a detailed elaboration of the action quadratic in\nR. The reverse use of the introduced method is exemplified in finding\nfunctional forms f(R) which lead to specified scale factor functions.

Under similar assumptions, the LASSO satisfies adaptive prediction\nbounds in various norms. The present note provides a prediction bound based on\na new index for measuring how favorable is a design matrix for the LASSO\nestimator. We study the behavior of our new index for matrices with independent\nrandom columns uniformly drawn on the unit sphere. Using the simple trick of\nappending such a random matrix (with the right number of columns) to a given\ndesign matrix, we show that a prediction bound similar to \\cite[Theorem\n2.1]{CandesPlan:AnnStat09} holds without any constraint on the design matrix,\nother than restricted non-singularity.\n","330583":"  Background: Inelastic neutrino-nucleus scattering through the weak\nneutral-current plays important role in stellar environment where transport of\nneutrinos determine the rate of cooling.

This feature displays a strong temperature dependence and is immediatly\nconnected to the binding energy of the molecular states, determined by the\ncoupling between the molecule and the substrate. At low temperatures, the\nline-width of this feature, appearing on top of the partly occupied lowest\nunoccupied molecular orbital of the free molecule, amounts to only $\\approx 25$\nmeV, representing an unusually small energy scale for electronic excitations in\nthese systems. We discuss possible origins, related e.g. to many-body\nexcitations in the organic-metal adsorbate system, in particular a generalized\nKondo scenario based on the single impurity Anderson model.\n","330585":"  We have analysed a sample of 23 hot DAs to better understand the source of\nthe circumstellar features reported in previous work. Unambiguous detections of\ncircumstellar material are again made at eight stars. The velocities of the\ncircumstellar material at three of the white dwarfs are coincident with the\nradial velocities of ISM along the sight line to the stars, suggesting that the\nobjects may be ionising the ISM in their locality. In three further cases, the\ncircumstellar velocities are close to the ISM velocities, indicating that these\nobjects are either ionising the ISM, or evaporated planetesimals\/material in a\ncircumstellar disc. The circumstellar velocity at WD 1614-084 lies far from the\nISM velocities, indicating either the ionisation of an undetected ISM component\nor circumstellar material. The material seen at WD 0232+035 can be attributed\nto the photoionisation of material lost from its M dwarf companion. The\nmeasured column densities of the circumstellar material lie within the ionised\nISM column density ranges predicted to exist in hot DA Stromgren spheres.\n","330586":"  Prime number multiplet classifications and patterns are extended to negative\nintegers.

The\ntwo and three particle correlations are presented as a function of collision\ncentrality and differentially vs. pseudorapidity and transverse momentum, and\nprovide strong constraints on the possible mechanism of background (parity\nconserving) and signal (parity odd) effects in heavy-ion collisions.\n","330590":"  Context. OB stars are important building blocks of the Universe, but we have\nonly a limited sample of them well understood enough from an\nasteroseismological point of view to provide feedback on the current\nevolutionary models. Our study adds one special case to this sample, with more\nobservational constraints than for most of these stars.\n  Aims. Our goal is to analyse and interpret the pulsational behaviour of the\nB3 IV star HD 43317 using the CoRoT light curve along with the ground-based\nspectroscopy gathered by the Harps instrument. This way we continue our efforts\nto map the Beta Cep and SPB instability strips.\n  Methods. We used different techniques to reveal the abundances and\nfundamental stellar parameters from the newly-obtained high-resolution spectra.\nWe used various time-series analysis tools to explore the nature of variations\npresent in the light curve. We calculated the moments and used the\npixel-by-pixel method to look for line profile variations in the\nhigh-resolution spectra.\n  Results. We find that HD 43317 is a single fast rotator (v_rot ~ 50% v_crit)\nand hybrid SPB\/Beta Cep-type pulsator with Solar metal abundances. We interpret\nthe variations in photometry and spectroscopy as a result of rotational\nmodulation connected to surface inhomogeneities, combined with the presence of\nboth g and p mode pulsations. We detect a series of ten consecutive frequencies\nwith an almost constant period spacing of 6339 s as well as a second shorter\nsequence consisting of seven frequencies with a spacing of 6380 s. The dominant\nfrequencies fall in the regime of gravito-inertial modes.\n","330591":"  We give an explicit description for a basis of a subgroup of finite index in\nthe group of central units of the integral group ring $\\Z G$ of a finite\nabelian-by-supersolvable group such that every cyclic subgroup of order not a\ndivisor of 4 or 6 is subnormal in $G$. The basis elements turn out to be a\nnatural product of conjugates of Bass units. This extends and generalizes a\nresult of Jespers, Parmenter and Sehgal showing that the Bass units generate a\nsubgroup of finite index in the center $\\mathcal{Z} (\\U (\\Z G))$ of the unit\ngroup $\\U (\\Z G)$ in case $G$ is a finite nilpotent group. Next, we give a new\nconstruction of units that generate a subgroup of finite index in\n$\\mathcal{Z}(\\U(\\Z G))$ for all finite strongly monomial groups $G$. We call\nthese units generalized Bass units. Finally, we show that the commutator group\n$\\U(\\Z G)\/\\U(\\Z G)'$ and $\\mathcal{Z}(\\U(\\Z G))$ have the same rank if $G$ is a\nfinite group such that $\\Q G$ has no epimorphic image which is either a\nnon-commutative division algebra other than a totally definite quaternion\nalgebra, or a two-by-two matrix algebra over a division algebra with center\neither the rationals or a quadratic imaginary extension of $\\Q$. This allows us\nto prove that in this case the natural images of the Bass units of $\\Z G$\ngenerate a subgroup of finite index in $\\U(\\Z G)\/\\U(\\Z G)'$.\n","330592":"  The need for small area estimates is increasingly felt in both the public and\nprivate sectors in order to formulate their strategic plans. It is now widely\nrecognized that direct small area survey estimates are highly unreliable owing\nto large standard errors and coefficients of variation. The reason behind this\nis that a survey is usually designed to achieve a specified level of accuracy\nat a higher level of geography than that of small areas. Lack of additional\nresources makes it almost imperative to use the same data to produce small area\nestimates. For example, if a survey is designed to estimate per capita income\nfor a state, the same survey data need to be used to produce similar estimates\nfor counties, subcounties and census divisions within that state. Thus, by\nnecessity, small area estimation needs explicit, or at least implicit, use of\nmodels to link these areas. Improved small area estimates are found by\n\"borrowing strength\" from similar neighboring areas.\n","330593":"  Binding energies and widths of three-body KbarNN, and of four-body KbarNNN\nand KbarKbarNN nuclear quasibound states are calculated in the hyperspherical\nbasis, using realistic NN potentials and subthreshold energy dependent chiral\nKbarN interactions. Results of previous K^-pp calculations are reproduced and\nan upper bound is placed on the binding energy of a K^-d quasibound state. A\nself consistent handling of energy dependence is found to restrain binding,\nkeeping the calculated four-body ground-state binding energies to relatively\nlow values of about 30 MeV. The lightest strangeness -2 particle-stable Kbar\nnuclear cluster is most probably KbarKbarNN. The calculated Kbar N -> pi Y\nconversion widths range from approximately 30 MeV for the KbarNNN ground state\nto approximately 80 MeV for the KbarKbarNN ground state.\n","330594":"  For two vertices $s$ and $t$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$, the next-to-shortest path\nis an $st$-path which length is minimum amongst all $st$-paths strictly longer\nthan the shortest path length. In this paper we show that, when the graph is\nundirected and all edge lengths are nonnegative, the problem can be solved in\nlinear time if the distances from $s$ and $t$ to all other vertices are given.\nThis result generalizes the previous work (DOI 10.1007\/s00453-011-9601-7) to\nallowing zero-length edges.\n","330595":"  An iterative method we previously proposed to compute nuclear strength\nfunctions is developed to allow it to accurately calculate properties of\nindividual nuclear states. The approach is based on the\nquasi-particle-random-phase approximation (QRPA) and uses an iterative\nnon-hermitian Arnoldi diagonalization method where the QRPA matrix does not\nhave to be explicitly calculated and stored. The method gives substantial\nadvantages over conventional QRPA calculations with regards to the\ncomputational cost. The method is used to calculate excitation energies and\ndecay rates of the lowest lying 2+ and 3- states in Pb, Sn, Ni and Ca isotopes\nusing three different Skyrme interactions and a separable gaussian pairing\nforce.\n","330596":"  Even after 25 years of research the pairing mechanism and - at least for\nelectron doped compounds - also the order parameter symmetry of the high\ntransition temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductors is still under debate.\nOne of the reasons is the complex crystal structure of most of these materials.\nAn exception are the infinite layer (IL) compounds consisting essentially of\nCuO2 planes. Unfortunately, these materials are difficult to grow and, thus,\nthere are only few experimental investigations. Recently, we succeeded in\ndepositing high quality films of the electron doped IL compound Sr1-xLaxCuO2\n(SLCO), with x approximately 0.15, and on the fabrication of well-defined grain\nboundary Josephson junctions (GBJs) based on such SLCO films. Here we report on\na phase sensitive study of the superconducting order parameter based on GBJ\nSQUIDs from a SLCO film grown on a tetracrystal substrate. Our results show\nthat also the parent structure of the high-Tc cuprates has dx2-y2-wave\nsymmetry, which thus seems to be inherent to cuprate superconductivity.\n","330597":"  Planck-scale quantum spacetime undergoes probabilistic local curvature\nfluctuations whose distributions cannot explicitly depend on position otherwise\nvacuum's small-scale quantum structure would fail to be statistically\nhomogeneous. Since the collection of fluctuations is a many-body system, the\nnatural explanation for their position-independent statistics is that they are\nin equilibrium with each other and distributed at maximum entropy.\nConsequently, their probability distributions obey the laws of statistical\nphysics which enforces small-scale smoothness, prevents the\nhomogeneity-violating diffusion found in any free quantum system, and maintains\ndecoherence. Their entropy, calculated using the explicitly-constructed phase\nspace of the Riemann whose statistics are derived using a\nbackground-independent graviton exchange ensemble, is proportional to the\nEinstein-Hilbert action evaluated on the macroscopic expected geometry and\nincludes a small, positive cosmological constant. Entropy maximization yields\nquantum spacetime's Ehrenfest equations of motion which are identical to\nEinstein's expectation-valued field equations. This background-independent\ndynamical formulation reveals curvature fluctuation entropy as a source of\nexpansion and raises the possibility that matter's zero-point energy problem,\nwhich is action-based and not energy shift invariant, may not be a problem\nafter all.\n","330598":"  We report measurements of the normal state in-plane magnetoconductance in\ngated LaAlO$_3$-SrTiO$_3$ samples. As the orientation of the magnetic field\nchanges within the plane of the interface, the signal displays periodic\noscillations with respect to the angle between the field and the direction of\nthe current. We show that in the underdoped to optimally doped range, a Fermi\nsurface reconstruction takes place due to the Rashba spin-orbit term and that\nthe oscillations are due to a magnetic field induced opening and closing of a\ngap at the $\\Gamma$ point for those Ti out-of-plane orbitals having their band\nminimum close to the Fermi energy of the system.\n","330599":"  A sieve is constructed for ordinary twin primes of the form 6m+\/-1 that are\ncharacterized by their twin rank m.

The scalar and pseudoscalar\nfields are responsible for the effective mass, while the pseudovector field is\nsimilar to ordinary electromagnetic field.

We apply the mean field approximation and find that there\nappears a vector condensate with finite average $<\\omega_0>$ depending on the\ntachyon density. The pressure and energy density of a many-tachyon system\ninclude the mean-field energy $<\\varepsilon_p>\n=\\sqrt{p^2+hpng^2\/M^2+n^2g^4\/M^4-m^2}$ which is real when the particle number\ndensity exceeds definite threshold which is $n>mM^2\/g^2$ for right-handed and\n$n>\\frac 2{\\sqrt{3}}mM^2\/g^2$ for left-handed tachyons, while all tachyons are\nsubluminal at high density.

Current rotating models were checked to provide\ngood fits to the following features: solar luminosity and radius at the solar\nage, main-sequence width, red-giant and red-supergiant (RSG) positions in the\nHRD, surface abundances, and rotational velocities. Rotating stellar models\npredict that about half of the observed WR stars and at least half of the type\nIbc SNe may be produced through the single-star evolution channel. Rotation\nincreases the duration of the WNL and WNC phases, while reducing those of the\nWNE and WC phases, as was already shown in previous works. Rotation increases\nthe frequency of type Ic SNe. The upper mass limit for type II-P SNe is \\sim\n19.0 MSun for the non rotating models and \\sim 16.8 MSun for the rotating ones.\nBoth values agree with observations. Moreover, present rotating models provide\na very good fit to the progenitor of SN 2008ax. We discuss future directions of\nresearch for further improving the agreement between the models and the\nobservations. We conclude that the mass-loss rates in the WNL and RSG phases\nare probably underestimated at present. We show that up to an initial mass of\n40 M\\odot, a surface magnetic field inferior to about 200 G may be sufficient\nto produce some braking. Much lower values are needed at the red supergiant\nstage. We suggest that the presence\/absence of any magnetic braking effect may\nplay a key role in questions regarding rotation rates of young pulsars and the\nevolution leading to LGRBs.\n","330603":"  In this paper we give the second weight codewords of the generalized\nReed-Muller code of order r and length $q^m$.\n","330604":"  A new concept of (asymptotic) qualitative robustness for plug-in estimators\nbased on identically distributed possibly dependent observations is introduced,\nand it is shown that Hampel's theorem for general metrics $d$ still holds.\nSince Hampel's theorem assumes the UGC property w.r.t. $d$, that is,\nconvergence in probability of the empirical probability measure to the true\nmarginal distribution w.r.t. $d$ uniformly in the class of all admissible laws\non the sample path space, this property is shown for a large class of strongly\nmixing laws for three different metrics $d$. For real-valued observations, the\nUGC property is established for both the Kolomogorov $\\phi$-metric and the\nL\\'{e}vy $\\psi$-metric, and for observations in a general locally compact and\nsecond countable Hausdorff space the UGC property is established for a certain\nmetric generating the $\\psi$-weak topology.

For a combination of direct\nand reverse reactions in the same chemical system, full thermodynamic branch is\npresented by an S-shaped curve, whose ends asymptotically achieve appropriate\ninitial states, which, in turn, are logistic ends of the opposite reactions.\nThe slope tangents of the steepest parts of the curves, the areas of the\nmaximum rate of the shift growth vs. the external thermodynamic force, occurred\nto be directly proportional to the force and, simultaneously, linearly\nproportional to the thermodynamic equivalent of chemical reaction, which is the\nratio between the amount in moles of any reaction participant, transformed in\nan isolated system, along the reaction way from its initial state to\nthermodynamic equilibrium, to its stoichiometric coefficient. The found\nlinearity is valid for arbitrary combination of the stoichiometric coefficients\nin a reaction of compound synthesis from chemical elements like aA+bB=AaBb, and\nconfirms the exclusive role of the thermodynamic equivalent of transformation\nas the chemical system characteristic of robustness and irreversibility.\nResults of this work allow for quantitative evaluation of the chemical system\nshift from thermodynamic equilibrium along thermodynamic branch and its rate\nvs. the shifting force.

The strategy\nadopted is to compute each secondary particle contribution of the\nelectromagnetic component and to construct the total signal at any location.\nSELFAS2 is a code which doesn't rely on air shower generators like AIRES or\nCORSIKA and it is based on the concept of air shower universality which makes\nit completely autonomous. Each positron and electron of the air shower is\ngenerated randomly following relevant distributions and tracking them along\ntheir travel in the atmosphere. We confirm in this paper earlier results that\nthe radio emission is mainly due to the time derivative of the transverse\ncurrent and the time derivative of the charge excess.

Most predictions about them have until now been\nbiased on algorithms yielding the expected linear and non-linear spectrum of\ndensity fluctuations. Even when simulations have been used, so-called Halofit\n(Smith et al 2003) predictions on fairly large scales have been needed. We wish\nto go beyond this limitation. We perform N-body and hydrodynamical simulations\nwithin a sufficiently large cosmological volume to allow a direct connection\nbetween simulations and linear spectra. While covering large length-scales, the\nsimulation resolution is good enough to allow us to explore the high-l\nharmonics of the cosmic shear (up to l ~ 50000), well into the domain where\nbaryon physics becomes important. We then compare shear spectra in the absence\nand in presence of various kinds of baryon physics, such as radiative cooling,\nstar formation, and supernova feedback in the form of galactic winds. We\ndistinguish several typical properties of matter fluctuation spectra in the\ndifferent simulations and test their impact on shear spectra. We compare our\noutputs with those obtainable using approximate expressions for non--linear\nspectra, and identify substantial discrepancies even between our results and\nthose of purely N-body results. Our simulations and the treatment of their\noutputs however enable us, for the first time, to obtain shear results taht are\nfully independent of any approximate expression, also in the high-l range,\nwhere we need to incorporate a non-linear power spectrum of density\nperturbations, and the effects of baryon physics.

Its\nbolometric luminosity and temperature, estimated from its spectral energy\ndistribution, are less than 0.04 L_sun and 16 K, respectively.

We suggest a possible scenario in which\nthe B2 ZAMS star driving the cavity has compressed the surrounding gas,\nperturbed its properties and induced the star formation in its immediate\nsurroundings.\n","330618":"  With the advances in computational technologies over the last decade, large\norganizations have been investing in Information Technology to automate their\ninternal processes to cut costs and efficiently support their business\nprojects. However, this comes to a price. Business requirements always change.\nLikewise, IT systems constantly evolves as developers make new versions of\nthem, which require endless administrative manual work to customize and\nconfigure them, especially if they are being used in different contexts, by\ndifferent types of users, and for different requirements. Autonomic computing\nwas conceived to provide an answer to these ever-changing requirements.\nEssentially, autonomic systems are self-configuring, self-healing,\nself-optimizing, and self-protecting; hence, they can automate all complex IT\nprocesses without human intervention. This paper proposes an autonomic model\nbased on Venn diagram and set theory for self-configuring C#.NET applications,\nnamely the self-customization of their GUI, event-handlers, and security\npermissions. The proposed model does not require altering the source-code of\nthe original application; rather, it uses an XML-based customization file to\nturn on and off the internal attributes of the application. Experiments\nconducted on the proposed model, showed a successful automatic customization\nfor C# applications and an effective self-adaption based on dynamic business\nrequirements. As future work, other programming languages such as Java and C++\nare to be supported, in addition to other operating systems such as Linux and\nMac so as to provide a standard platform-independent autonomic self-configuring\nmodel.\n","330619":"  An analysis is provided of the degradation that arises in the quality factor\nof a whispering gallery mode when a circular or spherical dielectric cavity is\ndeformed. The large quality factors of such resonators are important to their\nuse in applications such as sensors, wavelength filters or lasers. Yet a\nstraightforward analysis of the effect of shape deformation on quality factors\ncannot given because the underlying complex ray data demanded by a standard\neikonal approximation frequently does not exist. In this paper we exploit an\napproach that has been successfully used elsewhere to describe the strong\ndirectional emission of such systems, based on a perturbative treatment of the\nrelevant complex ray families. Applicable when the radial perturbation is\nformally of the order of a wavelength, the resulting approximation successfully\ndescribes changes to the quality factor using the ray geometry in a\nneighbourhood of a discrete set of escaping rays guiding the directions of\nmaximum emitted intensity.\n","330620":"  This paper studies a covering map phi from the upper half plane to the\ncomplex plane with a triangular lattice excised.

There is a homomorphism from the modular group Gamma to the\naffine transformations of the complex plane which preserve the excised lattice.\nWith respect to this action phi is a map of Gamma-sets. Identification of the\nexcised lattice with the root lattice of sl_3(C) allows functions familiar from\nthe study of modular functions to be expressed in terms of standard\nconstructions on representations of sl_3(C).\n","330621":"  At the present time, computers are employed to solve complex tasks and\nproblems ranging from simple calculations to intensive digital image processing\nand intricate algorithmic optimization problems to computationally-demanding\nweather forecasting problems. ASR short for Automatic Speech Recognition is yet\nanother type of computational problem whose purpose is to recognize human\nspoken speech and convert it into text that can be processed by a computer.\nDespite that ASR has many versatile and pervasive real-world applications,it is\nstill relatively erroneous and not perfectly solved as it is prone to produce\nspelling errors in the recognized text, especially if the ASR system is\noperating in a noisy environment, its vocabulary size is limited, and its input\nspeech is of bad or low quality. This paper proposes a post-editing ASR error\ncorrection method based on MicrosoftN-Gram dataset for detecting and correcting\nspelling errors generated by ASR systems. The proposed method comprises an\nerror detection algorithm for detecting word errors; a candidate corrections\ngeneration algorithm for generating correction suggestions for the detected\nword errors; and a context-sensitive error correction algorithm for selecting\nthe best candidate for correction. The virtue of using the Microsoft N-Gram\ndataset is that it contains real-world data and word sequences extracted from\nthe web which canmimica comprehensive dictionary of words having a large and\nall-inclusive vocabulary. Experiments conducted on numerous speeches, performed\nby different speakers, showed a remarkable reduction in ASR errors.

We first\ngive an easy-to-understand example of a function f from [-1, 1] into the space\nof polynomial functions from [0, 1] to R which is integrable on [-1, 1] but not\non [0, 1]. We also provide a way of representing graphically such a function\nwhich explains what means the integral of a function with values in an infinite\ndimensional space.

A number of such\ndevices have been analyzed. In some of them, the dependence of the critical\ncurrent on magnetic field, and the Multiple Andreev Reflections observed at\nfinite voltages, are compatible with the existence of topological\nsuperconductivity.\n","330625":"  Experiments and numerical simulations reveal that in the forward cascade\nregime, the energy spectrum of two-dimensional turbulence with Ekman friction\ndeviates from Kraichnan's prediction of $k^{-3}$ power spectrum. In this letter\nwe explain this observation using an analytic model based on variable enstrophy\nflux arising due to Ekman friction. We derive an expression for the enstrophy\nflux which exhibits a logarithmic dependence in the inertial range for the\nEkman-friction dominated flows. The energy spectrum obtained using this\nenstrophy flux shows a power law scaling for large Reynolds number and small\nEkman friction, but has an exponential behaviour for large Ekman friction and\nrelatively small Reynolds number.\n","330626":"  In human crowds as well as in many animal societies, local interactions among\nindividuals often give rise to self-organized collective organizations that\noffer functional benefits to the group. For instance, flows of pedestrians\nmoving in opposite directions spontaneously segregate into lanes of uniform\nwalking directions. This phenomenon is often referred to as a smart collective\npattern, as it increases the traffic efficiency with no need of external\ncontrol. However, the functional benefits of this emergent organization have\nnever been experimentally measured, and the underlying behavioral mechanisms\nare poorly understood. In this work, we have studied this phenomenon under\ncontrolled laboratory conditions. We found that the traffic segregation\nexhibits structural instabilities characterized by the alternation of organized\nand disorganized states, where the lifetime of well-organized clusters of\npedestrians follow a stretched exponential relaxation process. Further analysis\nshow that the inter-pedestrian variability of comfortable walking speeds is a\nkey variable at the origin of the observed traffic perturbations. We show that\nthe collective benefit of the emerging pattern is maximized when all\npedestrians walk at the average speed of the group. In practice, however, local\ninteractions between slow- and fast-walking pedestrians trigger global\nbreakdowns of organization, which reduce the collective and the individual\npayoff provided by the traffic segregation. This work is a step ahead toward\nthe understanding of traffic self-organization in crowds, which turns out to be\nmodulated by complex behavioral mechanisms that do not always maximize the\ngroup's benefits. The quantitative understanding of crowd behaviors opens the\nway for designing bottom-up management strategies bound to promote the\nemergence of efficient collective behaviors in crowds.\n","330627":"  (abridged) Strongly star-forming galaxies of subsolar metallicities are\ntypical of the high-redshift universe. Here we therefore provide accurate data\nfor two low-z analogs, the well-known low-metallicity emission-line galaxies\nHaro 11 and ESO 338-IG 004. On the basis of Very Large Telescope\/X-shooter\nspectroscopic observations in the wavelength range 3000-24000\\AA, we use\nstandard direct methods to derive physical conditions and element abundances.\nFurthermore, we use X-shooter data together with Spitzer observations in the\nmid-infrared range to attempt to find hidden star formation. We derive\ninterstellar oxygen abundances of 12 + log O\/H = 8.33+\/-0.01, 8.10+\/-0.04, and\n7.89+\/-0.01 in the two HII regions B and C of Haro 11 and in ESO 338-IG 004,\nrespectively. The observed fluxes of the hydrogen lines correspond to the\ntheoretical recombination values after correction for extinction with a single\nvalue of the extinction coefficient C(Hbeta) across the entire wavelength range\nfrom the near-ultraviolet to the NIR and mid-infrared for each of the studied\nHII regions. Therefore there are no emission-line regions contributing to the\nline emission in the NIR range, which are hidden in the optical range. The\nagreement between the extinction-corrected and CLOUDY-predicted fluxes implies\nthat a HII region model including only stellar photoionisation is able to\naccount for the observed fluxes, in both the optical and NIR ranges. All\nobserved spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can be reproduced quite well\nacross the whole wavelength range by model SEDs except for Haro 11B, where\nthere is a continuum flux excess at wavelengths >1.6mum. It is possible that\none or more red supergiant stars are responsible for the NIR flux excess in\nHaro 11B. We find evidence of a luminous blue variable (LBV) star in Haro 11C.\n","330628":"  We investigate within a coarse-grained model the conditions leading to the\nappearance of Fano resonances or anti-resonances in the conductance spectrum of\na generic molecular junction with a side group (T-junction). By introducing a\nsimple graphical representation (parabolic diagram), we can easily visualize\nthe relation between the different electronic parameters determining the\nregimes where Fano resonances or anti-resonances in the low-energy conductance\nspectrum can be expected. The results obtained within the coarse-grained model\nare validated using density-functional based quantum transport calculations in\nrealistic T-shaped molecular junctions.\n","330629":"  In this work, we introduce two spatio-temporal colored bounded noises, based\non the zero-dimensional Cai-Lin and Tsallis-Borland noises. We then study and\ncharacterize the dependence of the defined bounded noises on both a temporal\ncorrelation parameter $\\tau$ and on a spatial coupling parameter $\\lambda$. The\nboundedness of these noises has some consequences on their equilibrium\ndistributions. Indeed in some cases varying $\\lambda$ may induce a transition\nof the distribution of the noise from bimodality to unimodality. With the aim\nto study the role played by bounded noises on nonlinear dynamical systems, we\ninvestigate the behavior of the real Ginzburg-Landau time-varying model\nadditively perturbed by such noises. The observed phase transitions\nphenomenology is quite different from the one observed when the perturbations\nare unbounded. In particular, we observed an inverse \"order-to-disorder\"\ntransition, and a re-entrant transition, with dependence on the specific type\nof bounded noise.\n","330630":"  GM Cep in the young (~4 Myr) open cluster Trumpler 37 has been known to be an\nabrupt variable and to have a circumstellar disk with very active accretion.\nOur monitoring observations in 2009-2011 revealed the star to show sporadic\nflare events, each with brightening of < 0.5 mag lasting for days. These\nbrightening events, associated with a color change toward the blue, should\noriginate from an increased accretion activity. Moreover, the star also\nunderwent a brightness drop of ~1 mag lasting for about a month, during which\nthe star became bluer when fainter. Such brightness drops seem to have a\nrecurrence time scale of a year, as evidenced in our data and the photometric\nbehavior of GM Cep over a century. Between consecutive drops, the star\nbrightened gradually by about 1 mag and became blue at peak luminosity. We\npropose that the drop is caused by obscuration of the central star by an\norbiting dust concentration. The UX Orionis type of activity in GM Cep\ntherefore exemplifies the disk inhomogeneity process in transition between\ngrain coagulation and planetesimal formation in a young circumstellar disk.\n","330631":"  We use x-ray absorption and magnetic circular dichroism to study electronic\nconfiguration and local susceptibility of CePt5\/Pt(111) surface alloys from\nwell above to well below the impurity Kondo temperature.

As a step towards its full\nunderstanding, we construct a generating functional from which we derive the\nposition non equilibrium correlation function of a quantum Brownian particle\nwith general Gaussian non-factorizing initial conditions. We investigate the\nslow dynamics of a particle confined in a harmonic potential after a position\nmeasurement; the rapid relaxation of a particle trapped in a harmonic potential\nafter a quantum quench realized as a sudden change in the potential parameters;\nand the evolution of an impurity in contact with a one dimensional bosonic\nquantum gas.

As an example we present numerical simulations for a\nmixture of five species, labelled according to their increasing size, so that\nspecies 2 and 4 simultaneously move in one direction and species 1, 3, and 5 in\nthe other. The selection of species to be separated from the others can be\nchanged at any time by simply adapting the voltage protocol.

It is found that the equation of state is\nvery sensitive to the particular thermodynamic route used to obtain it.\nSpecifically, the osmotic pressure calculated within the RJM using the contact\nvalue theorem can be very different from the pressure calculated using the\nKirkwood-Buff fluctuation relations. On the other hand, Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations show that both the effective pair potentials and the correlation\nfunctions are accurately predicted by the RJM. It is suggested that the lack of\nself-consistency in the thermodynamics of the RJM is a result of neglected\nelectrostatic correlations between the counterions and coions.\n","330635":"  We study the question, whether a Riemann-Stieltjes integral of a positive\ncontinuous function with respect to a non-negative function of bounded\nvariation is positive.\n","330636":"  HD 133880 is a rapidly rotating Bp star and host to one of the strongest\nmagnetic fields of any Bp star. A member of the Upper Centaurus Lupus\nassociation, it is a star with a well-determined age of 16 Myr. Twelve new\nspectra obtained from the FEROS, ESPaDOnS, and HARPS instruments, provide\nsufficient material from which to re-evaluate the magnetic field and obtain a\nfirst approximation to the atmospheric abundance distributions of various\nelements. Using the new magnetic field measurements and optical photometry\ntogether with previously published data, we refine the period of HD 133880 to P\n= 0.877476 \\pm 0.000009 days. The magnetic field structure was characterised by\na colinear multipole expansion from the observed variations of the longitudinal\nand surface fields with rotational phase. This simple axisymmetric magnetic\nfield model is based on a predominantly quadrupolar component that roughly\ndescribes the field variations. Using spectrum synthesis, we derived mean\nabundances for O, Mg, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, Nd and Pr. All elements, except Mg (which\nhas a uniform distribution), are overabundant compared to the Sun and are more\nabundant in the negative than in the positive magnetic hemisphere. In contrast\nto most Bp stars the abundance of O in HD 133880 is overabundant compared to\nthe solar abundance ratio. In studying the Halpha and Paschen lines in the\noptical spectra we could not unambiguously detect information about the\nmagnetosphere of HD 133880. However, radio emission data at both 3 and 6 cm\nsuggests that the magnetospheric plasma is held in rigid rotation with the star\nby the magnetic field and further supported against collapse by the rapid\nrotation. Subtle differences in the shapes of the optically thick radio light\ncurves at 3 and 6 cm suggest that the large-scale magnetic field is not fully\naxisymmetric at large distances from the star.\n","330637":"  Applying exact QCD sum rules for the baryon charge and energy-momentum we\ndemonstrate that if nucleons are the only degrees of freedom of nuclear wave\nfunction, the structure function of a nucleus would be the additive sum of the\nnucleon distributions at the same Bjorken x = AQ^2\/2(p_Aq)< 0.5 up to very\nsmall Fermi motion corrections if x>0.05. Thus the difference of the EMC ratio\nfrom one reveals the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclei.\nUsing exact QCD sum rules we show that the ratio R_A(x_p,Q^2) used in\nexperimental studies, where x_p = Q^2\/2q_0 m_p deviates from one even if a\nnucleus consists of nucleons with small momenta only. Use of the Bjorken x\nleads to additional decrease of R_A(x,Q^2) as compared to the x_p plots.\nCoherent contribution of equivalent photons into photon component of parton\nwave function of a nucleus unambiguously follows from Lorentz transformation of\nthe rest frame nucleus Coulomb field. For A~200 photons carry ~0.0065 fraction\nof the light momentum of nucleus almost compensates the difference between data\nanalysis in terms of Bjorken x and x_p. Different role of higher twist effects\nfor Q^2 probed at electron and muon beams is emphasized. Direct observations of\nlarge and predominantly nucleonic short-range correlations in nuclei pose a\nserious challenge for most of the models of the EMC effect for x>0.6. The data\nare consistent with a scenario in which the hadronic EMC effect reflects\nfluctuations of inter nucleon interaction due to fluctuations of color\ndistribution in the interacting nucleons. The dynamic realization of this\nscenario is the model in which the 3q (3qg) configurations with x > 0.5 parton\nhave a weaker interaction with nearby nucleons, leading to suppression of such\nconfigurations giving a right magnitude of the EMC effect. The directions for\nthe future studies and challenging questions are outlined.\n","330638":"  In this study, we examine the social networking practices of the 100 largest\nnonprofit organizations in the United States. More specifically, we develop a\ncomprehensive classification scheme to delineate these organizations' use of\nFacebook as a stakeholder engagement tool. We find that there are 5 primary\ncategories of Facebook \"statuses\", which can be aggregated into three key\ndimensions - \"information\", \"community\", and \"action\". Our analysis reveals\nthat, though the \"informational\" use of Facebook is still significant,\nnonprofit organizations are better at using Facebook to strategically engage\ntheir stakeholders via \"dialogic\" and \"community-building\" practices than they\nhave been with traditional websites. The adoption of social media seems to have\nengendered new paradigms of public engagement.\n","330639":"  We examine how the atomic and molecular gas components of galaxies evolve to\nhigher redshifts using the semi-analytic galaxy formation models of Fu et al.\n(2010) in which we track the surface density profiles of gas in disks. We adopt\ntwo different prescriptions based either on gas surface density and\nmetallicity, or on interstellar pressure, to compute the molecular fraction as\na function of radius in each disk. We demonstrate that the adopted star\nformation law determines how the {\\em balance} between gas, stars and metals\nchanges with time in the star-forming galaxy population, but does not influence\nthe total mass in stars formed into galaxies at redshifts below $z\\sim 2.5$.\nThe redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation places strong\nconstraints on the timescale over which cold gas is converted into stars in\nhigh redshift galaxies, and favours models where this remains constant at\nvalues around 1-2 Gyr. Future observations of the evolution of the average\nmolecular-to-atomic gas ratio in galaxies as a function of stellar mass and\nredshift will constrain models of the atomic-to-molecular transition.\n","330640":"  We investigate the effects of newly measured beta-decay half-lives on\nr-process nucleosynthesis. These new rates were determined by recent\nexperiments at the radioactive isotope beam factory facility in the RIKEN\nNishina Center. We adopt an r-process nucleosynthesis environment based on a\nmagnetohydrodynamic supernova explosion model that includes strong magnetic\nfields and rapid rotation of the progenitor. A number of the new beta-decay\nrates are for nuclei on or near the r-process path, and hence they affect the\nnucleosynthesis yields and time scale of the r-process. The main effect of the\nnewly measured beta-decay half-lives is an enhancement in the calculated\nabundance of isotopes with mass number A = 110 -- 120 relative to calculated\nabundances based upon beta-decay rates estimated with the finite-range droplet\nmass model. This effect slightly alleviates, but does not fully explain, the\ntendency of r-process models to underproduce isotopes with A = 110 -- 120\ncompared to the solar-system r-process abundances.\n","330641":"  The Beam Emission Spectroscopy (BES) turbulence diagnostic on MAST is to be\nupgraded in June 2010 from a 1D trial system to a 2D imaging system (8 radial\n\\times 4 poloidal channels) based on a newly developed APD array camera. The\nspatial resolution of the new system is calculated in terms of the point spread\nfunction (PSF) to account for the effects of field-line curvature, observation\ngeometry, the finite lifetime of the excited state of the beam atoms, and beam\nattenuation and divergence. It is found that the radial spatial resolution is ~\n2-3 cm and the poloidal spatial resolution ~ 1-5 cm depending on the radial\nviewing location.

First we provide\ngeneral arguments for why any ghost analysis in the Stuckelberg formulation has\nto agree with existing consistency proofs that have been carried out without\nusing Stuckelberg fields. We then demonstrate the absence of the ghost at the\ncompletely nonlinear level in the Stuckelberg formulation of the minimal\nmassive gravity action. The constraint that removes the ghost field and the\nassociated secondary constraint that eliminates its conjugate momentum are\ncomputed explicitly, confirming the consistency of the theory in the\nStuckelberg formulation.\n","330643":"  It is shown that perturbative reheating can reach a sufficiently high\ntemperature with small or negligible inflaton decay rate provided that the\ninflaton potential becomes negative after inflation.

To clean the foreground contributions we use parametric, maximum\nlikelihood component separation technique, and consider experimental setups\noptimized to render a minimal level of the foreground residuals in the\nrecovered CMB map. We consider nearly full-sky observations, include two\ndiffuse foreground components, dust and synchrotron, and study cases with and\nwithout calibration errors, spatial variability of the foreground properties,\nand partial or complete B-mode lensing signal removal.\n  In all these cases we find that in the limit of very low noise level and in\nthe absence of the intrumental or modeling systematic effects, the foreground\nresiduals do not lead to a limit on the lowest detectable value of r. But the\nneed to control the foreground residuals will play a major role in determining\nthe minimal noise levels necessary to permit a robust detection of r < 0.1 and\ntherefore in optimizing and forecasting the performance of the future missions.\nFor current and proposed experiments noise levels, the foreground residuals are\nfound non-negligible and potentially can affect our ability to set constraints\non r. We also show how the constraints can be significantly improved on by\nrestricting the post component separation processing to a smaller sky area.\nThis procedure applied to a case of a COrE-like satellite mission is shown to\nresult potentially in over an order of magnitude improvement in the detectable\nvalue of r. With sufficient knowledge of the experimental bandpasses as well as\nforeground component scaling laws, our conclusions are found to be independent\non the assumed overall normalization of the foregrounds and only quantitatively\ndepend on specific parametrizations assumed for the foreground components.\n","330645":"  The time of occurrence of the large EQ that occurred recently in Mexico\n(March 20th, 2012, Mw = 7.4) is compared to the peak amplitude occurrence time\nof the local M1 and K1 tidal components.

We demonstrate that tunneling plays the crucial role in the\nformation of the Rabi-like spin-flip transitions. In contrast to the linear\nbehavior for weak electric fields, the spin flip rate becomes much smaller than\nexpected for the two-level model and shows oscillating dependence on the\ndriving field amplitude in stronger fields. In addition, the full spin flip is\nvery difficult to achieve in a multi-level resonant system. These two effects\nhave a similarity with the Zeno effect of slowing down the dynamics of an\nobservable by its measurement.

This embedding structure is an invariant\nof $X$ up to homeomorphism. This circumstance gives the top homology the\nstructure of an (orientable) matroid, where cycles in the sense of matroids\ncorrespond to the cycles in the sense of homology. This adds a novel\ntopological invariant to the topological literature.\n  We apply this matroid structure on the top homology to give a polynomial-time\nalgorithm for the construction of a basis of the top homology (over\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients).\n","330648":"  The design of deterministic filters can be cast as a problem of minimizing an\nassociated cost function for an optimal control problem.

The catalogue data contains a\nsignificant number of false sources clustered around bright stars. A large\nfraction of these artefacts were automatically filtered out before or during\nthe cluster search. The UKIDSS data reduction pipeline tends to classify\nmarginally resolved stellar pairs and objects seen against variable surface\nbrightness as extended objects (or \"galaxies\" in the archive parlance). 10% or\n66 x 10^6 of the sources in the UKIDSS GPS catalogue brighter than 17\nmagnitudes in the K band are classified as \"galaxies\". Young embedded clusters\ncreate variable NIR surface brightness because the gas\/dust clouds in which\nthey were formed scatters the light from the cluster members. Such clusters\nappear therefore as clusters of \"galaxies\" in the catalogue and can be found\nusing only a subset of the catalogue data.

In particular, two excitation gaps originating from magnetic\nanisotropies have been clearly observed. The direct observation of the gaps\nenables us to accurately determine the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction\nand the single ion anisotropy. The DM interaction supports a strong\nmagneto-electric coupling in this compound.\n","330654":"  We consider the functional $$I_\\Omega(v) = \\int_\\Omega [f(|Dv|) - v] dx,$$\nwhere $\\Omega$ is a bounded domain and $f$ is a convex function. Under general\nassumptions on $f$, G. Crasta [Cr1] has shown that if $I_\\Omega$ admits a\nminimizer in $W_0^{1,1}(\\Omega)$ depending only on the distance from the\nboundary of $\\Omega$, then $\\Omega$ must be a ball. With some restrictions on\n$f$, we prove that spherical symmetry can be obtained only by assuming that the\nminimizer has one level surface parallel to the boundary (i.e. it has only a\nlevel surface in common with the distance).\n  We then discuss how these results extend to more general settings, in\nparticular to functionals that are not differentiable and to solutions of fully\nnonlinear elliptic and parabolic equations.\n","330655":"  We study parametrized families of orthogonal projections for which the\ndimension of the parameter space is strictly less than that of the Grassmann\nmanifold.

We also show that a similar result\nis valid for smooth families of maps from $n$-dimensional Euclidean space to\n$m$-dimensional one.\n","330656":"  The late stages of large-scale structure evolution are treated\nsemi-analytically within the framework of modified halo model. We suggest\nsimple yet accurate approximation for relating the non-linear amplitude to\nlinear one for spherical density perturbation. For halo concentration\nparameter, $c$, a new computation technique is proposed, which eliminates the\nneed of interim evaluation of the $z_{col}$. Validity of the technique is\nproved for $\\Lambda$CDM and $\\Lambda$WDM cosmologies. Also, the parameters for\nSheth-Tormen mass function are estimated. The modified and extended halo model\nis applied for determination of non-linear power spectrum of dark matter, as\nwell as for galaxy power spectrum estimation. The semi-analytical techniques\nfor dark matter power spectrum are verified by comparison with data from\nnumerical simulations. Also, the predictions for the galaxy power spectra are\nconfronted with 'observed' data from PSCz and SDSS galaxy catalogs, good\naccordance is found.\n","330657":"  We consider a simple stochastic model of a urban rental housing market, in\nwhich the interaction of tenants and landlords induces rent fluctuations. We\nsimulate the model numerically and measure the equilibrium rent distribution,\nwhich is found to be close to a lognormal law. We also study the influence of\nthe density of agents (or equivalently, the vacancy rate) on the rent\ndistribution. A simplified version of the model, amenable to analytical\ntreatment, is studied and leads to a lognormal distribution of rents. The\npredicted equilibrium value agrees quantitatively with numerical simulations,\nwhile a qualitative agreement is obtained for the standard deviation. The\nconnection with non-equilibrium statistical physics models like ratchets is\nalso emphasized.\n","330658":"  In a series of paper, it has been shown that the distribution of polarisation\nposition angles for visible light from quasars is not random in extremely large\nregions of the sky. As explained in a recent article, the measurement of\nvanishing circular polarisation for such quasars is an important problem for a\nmechanism involving the mixing with axion-like particles in external magnetic\nfields. In this note, we stress that a recent report of similar coherent\norientations of polarisation in radiowaves further disfavours the need for such\nparticles, as an effect at these wavelengths would be extremely suppressed or\nwould directly contradict data.\n","330659":"  We present several matrix and operator inequalities of Hermite-Hadamard type.\nWe first establish a majorization version for monotone convex functions on\nmatrices.

We explore several hadron ratios\n(K\/pi, p\/pi, Lambda\/pi, Xi\/pi) within a hydrodynamic model with hadronic after\nburner, namely UrQMD 3.3, and show that the deviations can be understood as a\nfinal state effect. We propose the p\/pi as an observable sensitive on whether\nfinal state interactions take place or not. The measured values of the hadron\nratios do then allow to gauge the transition energy density from hydrodynamics\nto the Boltzmann description. We find that the data can be explained with\ntransition energy densities of 840 +- 150 MeV\/fm^3.\n","330662":"  The size-change abstraction (SCA) is an important program abstraction for\ntermination analysis, which has been successfully implemented in many tools for\nfunctional and logic programs. In this paper, we demonstrate that SCA is also a\nhighly effective abstract domain for the bound analysis of imperative programs.\n  We have implemented a bound analysis tool based on SCA for imperative\nprograms. We abstract programs in a pathwise and context dependent manner,\nwhich enables our tool to analyze real-world programs effectively.

This method\nis based on a Newton-Cotes quadrature rule for integral approximation and an\nFFT method for discrete summation that results in an $O(Nlog(N))$ computational\ncost, where $N$ is the number of grid points. Using the Simpson quadrature rule\nwith an accuracy of $O(h^4)$, where $h$ is the grid size, we present numerical\ncalculation of the wakefields from a resonator wake function model and from a\none-dimensional coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) wake model. Besides the\nfast speed and high numerical accuracy, the calculation using the direct line\ndensity instead of the first derivative of the line density avoids numerical\nfiltering of the electron density function for computing the CSR wakefield\nforce.\n","330665":"  We measure the quasar two-point correlation function over the redshift range\n2.2<z<2.8 using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We use a\nhomogeneous subset of the data consisting of 27,129 quasars with spectroscopic\nredshifts---by far the largest such sample used for clustering measurements at\nthese redshifts to date. The sample covers 3,600 square degrees, corresponding\nto a comoving volume of 9.7(Gpc\/h)^3 assuming a fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology,\nand it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of -26, k-corrected to z=2. After\naccounting for redshift errors we find that the redshift space correlation\nfunction is fit well by a power-law of slope -2 and amplitude s_0=(9.7\\pm\n0.5)Mpc\/h over the range 3<s<25Mpc\/h. The projected correlation function, which\nintegrates out the effects of peculiar velocities and redshift errors, is fit\nwell by a power-law of slope -1 and r_0=(8.4\\pm 0.6)Mpc\/h over the range\n4<R<16Mpc\/h. There is no evidence for strong luminosity or redshift dependence\nto the clustering amplitude, in part because of the limited dynamic range in\nour sample. Our results are consistent with, but more precise than, previous\nmeasurements at similar redshifts. Our measurement of the quasar clustering\namplitude implies a bias factor of b~3.5 for our quasar sample. We compare the\ndata to models to constrain the manner in which quasars occupy dark matter\nhalos at z~2.4 and infer that such quasars inhabit halos with a characteristic\nmass of <M>~10^{12}Msun\/h with a duty cycle for the quasar activity of 1 per\ncent.\n","330666":"  In this note we present various extensions of Obata's rigidity theorem\nconcerning the Hessian of a function on a Riemannian manifold.

This well-known condition is\na strong version of the uncertainty principle, which can be reinterpreted in\nterms of the topological notion of symplectic capacity, closely related to\nGromov's non-squeezing theorem. We show that a recent refinement of the latter\nleads to a new class of geometric invariants. These are the volumes of the\northogonal projections of the covariance ellipsoid on symplectic subspaces of\nthe phase space. We compare these geometric invariants to the algebraic\n\"universal quantum invariants\" of Dodonov and Serafini.\n","330670":"  We present the first search for supersymmetry (SUSY) in Zgamma final states\nwith large missing transverse energy using data corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 6.2 fb-1 collected with the D0 experiment in ppbar collisions at\nsqrt(s)=1.96 TeV. This signature is predicted in gauge-mediated SUSY-breaking\nmodels, where the lightest neutralino is the next-to-lightest supersymmetric\nparticle (NLSP) and is produced in pairs, possibly through decay from heavier\nsupersymmetric particles. The NLSP can decay either to a Z boson or a photon\nand an associated gravitino that escapes detection. We exclude this model at\nthe 95% C.L. for SUSY breaking scales of Lambda < 87 TeV, corresponding to\nneutralino masses of < 151 GeV.\n","330671":"  It is conventional to choose a typical momentum transfer of the process as\nthe renormalization scale and take an arbitrary range to estimate the\nuncertainty in the QCD prediction. However, predictions using this procedure\ndepend on the renormalization scheme, leave a non-convergent renormalon\nperturbative series, and moreover, one obtains incorrect results when applied\nto QED processes. In contrast, if one fixes the renormalization scale using the\nPrinciple of Maximum Conformality (PMC), all non-conformal $\\{\\beta_i\\}$-terms\nin the perturbative expansion series are summed into the running coupling, and\none obtains a unique, scale-fixed, scheme-independent prediction at any finite\norder. The PMC scale $\\mu^{\\rm PMC}_R$ and the resulting finite-order PMC\nprediction are both to high accuracy independent of the choice of initial\nrenormalization scale $\\mu^{\\rm init}_R$, consistent with renormalization group\ninvariance. As an application, we apply the PMC procedure to obtain NNLO\npredictions for the $t\\bar{t}$-pair production at the Tevatron and LHC\ncolliders. The PMC prediction for the total cross-section $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$\nagrees well with the present Tevatron and LHC data. We also verify that the\ninitial scale-independence of the PMC prediction is satisfied to high accuracy\nat the NNLO level: the total cross-section remains almost unchanged even when\ntaking very disparate initial scales $\\mu^{\\rm init}_R$ equal to $m_t$,\n$20\\,m_t$, $\\sqrt{s}$. Moreover, after PMC scale setting, we obtain\n$A_{FB}^{t\\bar{t}} \\simeq 12.5%$, $A_{FB}^{p\\bar{p}} \\simeq 8.28%$ and\n$A_{FB}^{t\\bar{t}}(M_{t\\bar{t}}>450 \\;{\\rm GeV}) \\simeq 35.0%$. These\npredictions have a $1\\,\\sigma$-deviation from the present CDF and D0\nmeasurements; the large discrepancy of the top quark forward-backward asymmetry\nbetween the Standard Model estimate and the data are thus greatly reduced.\n","330672":"  We extend the Fixed Center Approximation (FCA) to the Faddeev Equations for\nthe $\\bar{K} NN$ system with S=0, including the charge exchange mechanisms in\nthe $\\bar{K}$ rescattering which have been ignored in former works within the\nFCA. We obtain similar results to those found before, but the binding is\nreduced by 6 MeV. At the same time we also evaluate the explicit contribution\nthe $\\pi N \\Sigma$ intermediate state in the three body system and find that it\nproduces and additional small decrease in the binding of about 3 MeV.

Based on a recent\nglobal analysis of low-energy and LEP constraints of these models, we perform\nnumerical scans of their various signals at the LHC. We show that total cross\nsections for lepton and third-generation quark pairs, while experimentally\neasily accessible, provide individually only partial information about the\nmodel realized in Nature. In contrast, correlations of these cross sections in\nthe neutral and charged current channels may well lead to a unique\nidentification.\n","330674":"  We compare early ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia)\nwith theoretical predictions for the brightness of the shock associated with\nthe collision between SN ejecta and a companion star. Our simple method is\nindependent of the intrinsic flux from the SN and treats the flux observed with\nthe Swift\/Ultra-Violet Optical Telescope (UVOT) as conservative upper limits on\nthe shock brightness. Comparing this limit with the predicted flux for various\nshock models, we constrain the geometry of the SN progenitor-companion system.\nWe find the model of a 1 M_sun red supergiant companion in Roche lobe overflow\nto be excluded at a 95% confidence level for most individual SNe for all but\nthe most unfavorable viewing angles. For the sample of 12 SNe taken together,\nthe upper limits on the viewing angle are inconsistent with the expected\ndistribution of viewing angles for RG stars as the majority of companions with\nhigh confidence. The separation distance constraints do allow MS companions. A\nbetter understanding of the UV flux arising from the SN itself as well as\ncontinued UV observations of young SNe Ia will further constrain the possible\nprogenitors of SNe Ia.\n","330675":"  We study the thermalization process in the self-interacting curvaton\npreheating scenario.

After this we calculate the generated non-gaussianity\nwith the $\\Delta N$ formalism and the separate universe approximation by\nrunning a large number of simulations with slightly different initial values.\nThe results indicate a high level of non-gaussianity.

The scaling properties are derived by\nintegrating the renormalization group flow equations up to a scale where they\ncan be reliably matched to simple analytic expressions. The vortex fugacity\nturns out to be dangerously irrelevant for these quantities below Tc, thereby\naltering the scaling behavior. We derive the possible crossover effects as the\ncurrent, magnetic field, or system size is varied, and find a strong\nmultiplicative logarithmic correction near Tc, all of which is necessary to\naccount for when interpreting experiments and simulation data. Our analysis\nclarifies a longstanding discrepancy between the finite size dependence found\nin many simulations and the current-voltage characteristics of experiments. We\nfurther show that the logarithmic correction can be avoided by approaching the\ntransition in a magnetic field, thereby simplifying the scaling analysis.

The\nevaluation points are chosen so that the encoded symbols at any node are\nconjugates of each other, while corresponding symbols of different nodes are\nlinearly dependent with respect to GF(q). These properties ensure that data\nrepair can be carried out over the base field GF(q), instead of matrix\ninversion over the extension field required by some existing exact-MBR codes.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this approach is novel in the construction of\nexact-MBR codes. One of our constructions leads to exact-MBR codes with\narbitrary parameters. These exact-MBR codes have higher data reconstruction\ncomplexities but lower data repair complexities than their counterparts based\non the product-matrix approach; hence they may be suitable for applications\nthat need a small number of data reconstructions but a large number of data\nrepairs.\n","330685":"  In this paper we describe an approach to Casimir Force problems that is\nultimately generalizable to all fields, boundary conditions, and cavity\ngeometries.

The stellar surface density maps of the sample galaxies were derived\nfrom the archival data of SINGS and SDSS. The corresponding molecular and\natomic surface densities were derived from archival CO(1-0) and HI\ninterferometric observations of the BIMA SONG, THINGS, and VIVA surveys. The\nmethod used for determining the radial mass flow rates follows from our\nprevious work using the potential-density phase shift approach, which utilizes\na volume-type torque integral to calculate the angular momentum exchange rate\nbetween the basic state disk matter and the density wave modes. This approach\nyields radial mass flow rates and angular momentum transport rates several\ntimes higher than similar rates estimated using the traditional method of\ngravitational torque couple of Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs 1972, and this\ndifference reflects the dominant role played by collisionless shocks in the\nsecular evolution of galaxies containing extremely non-linear, quasi-steady\ndensity wave modes. It is shown that these non-linear modes maintains their\nquasi-steady state at the expense of a continuous radial mass flow and the\nresulting morphological transformation of galaxies throughout their lifetime,\nnot only for late-type and intermediate-type disk galaxies but, under favorable\nconditions, also for earlier types including S0s and disky ellipticals.

We base our analysis on the\ngalaxy formation models of Guo et al., run on the Millennium Simulations. We\nquantify the importance of these effects by randomizing the angular positions\nof satellite galaxies within haloes, either coherently or individually, while\nkeeping the distance to their respective central galaxies fixed. We find that\nthe effect of disrupting the alignment with larger scale structure is a ~2 per\ncent decrease in the galaxy correlation function around r=1.8 Mpc\/h. We find\nthat sphericalizing the ellipsoidal distributions of galaxies within haloes\ndecreases the correlation function by up to 20 per cent for r<1 Mpc\/h and\nincreases it slightly at somewhat larger radii. Similar results apply to power\nspectra and redshift-space correlation functions. Models based on the Halo\nOccupation Distribution, which place galaxies spherically within haloes\naccording to a mean radial profile, will therefore significantly underestimate\nthe clustering on sub-Mpc scales. In addition, we find that halo assembly bias,\nin particular the dependence of clustering on halo shape, propagates to the\nclustering of galaxies.

A significant full-band\n(soft-band) excess of \\sim78 (67) X-ray point sources is found in the cluster\nfields within an angular distance of 8' (4Mpc) at a statistical confidence\nlevel of 4.0 sigma (4.2 sigma), corresponding to an average number of detected\nexcess AGN per cluster environment of 3.5\\pm0.9 (3.0\\pm0.7). The data point\ntowards a rising radial profile in the cluster region (r<1Mpc) of predominantly\nlow-luminosity AGN with an average detected excess of about one point source\nper system, with a tentative preferred occurrence along the main cluster\nelongation axis. A second statistically significant overdensity of brighter\nsoft-band detected AGN is found at cluster-centric distances of 4'-6' (2-3Mpc),\ncorresponding to about three times the average cluster radius R200 of the\nsystems. If confirmed, these results would support the idea of two different\nphysical triggering mechanisms of X-ray AGN activity in dependence of the\nradially changing large-scale structure environment of the distant clusters.\n","330697":"  We present higher-derivative gravities that propagate an arbitrary number of\ngravitons of different mass on (A)dS backgrounds. These theories have multiple\ncritical points, at which the masses degenerate and the graviton energies are\nnon-negative. For six derivatives and higher there are critical points with\npositive energy.\n","330698":"  We apply a recently developed scaling technique to the Millennium-XXL, one of\nthe largest cosmological N-body simulations carried out to date 3x10^11\nparticles within a cube of volume ~70Gpc^3). This allows us to investigate the\ncosmological parameter dependence of the mass and evolution of haloes in the\nextreme high-mass tail of the z=6 distribution. We assume these objects to be\nlikely hosts for the population of rare but ultraluminous high-redshift quasars\ndiscovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Haloes with a similar abundance to\nthese quasars have a median mass of 9x10^12 Msun in the currently preferred\ncosmology, but do not evolve into equally extreme objects at z=0. Rather, their\ndescendants span the full range conventionally assigned to present-day\nclusters, 6x10^13 to 2.5x10^15 Msun for this same cosmology. The masses both at\nz=6 and at z=0 shift up or down by factors exceeding two if cosmological\nparameters are pushed to the boundaries of the range discussed in published\ninterpretations of data from the WMAP satellite. The main factor determining\nthe future growth of a high-mass z=6 halo is the mean overdensity of its\nenvironment on scales of 7 to 14 Mpc, and descendant masses can be predicted 6\nto 8 times more accurately if this density is known than if it is not. All\nthese features are not unique to extreme high-z haloes, but are generic to\nhierarchical growth. Finally, we find that extreme haloes at z=6 typically\nacquired about half of their total mass in the preceding 100 Myr, implying very\nlarge recent accretion rates which may be related to the large black hole\nmasses and high luminosities of the SDSS quasars.\n","330699":"  We study neutrino physics in the context of a supersymmetric model where a\ncontinuous R-symmetry is identified with the total Lepton Number and one\nsneutrino can thus play the role of the down type Higgs. We show that\nR-breaking effects communicated to the visible sector by Anomaly Mediation can\nreproduce neutrino masses and mixing solely via radiative contributions,\nwithout requiring any additional degree of freedom. In particular, a relatively\nlarge reactor angle (as recently observed by the Daya Bay collaboration) can be\naccommodated in ample regions of the parameter space. On the contrary, if the\nR-breaking is communicated to the visible sector by gravitational effects at\nthe Planck scale, additional particles are necessary to accommodate neutrino\ndata.\n","330700":"  The real-world properties of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) - the\nstrongly-interacting piece of the Standard Model - are dominated by two\nemergent phenomena: confinement; namely, the theory's elementary\ndegrees-of-freedom - quarks and gluons - have never been detected in isolation;\nand dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB), which is a remarkably effective\nmass generating mechanism, responsible for the mass of more than 98% of visible\nmatter in the Universe. These phenomena are not apparent in the formulae that\ndefine QCD, yet they play a principal role in determining Nature's observable\ncharacteristics. Much remains to be learnt before confinement can properly be\nunderstood. On the other hand,the last decade has seen important progress in\nthe use of relativistic quantum field theory, so that we can now explain the\norigin of DCSB and are beginning to demonstrate its far-reaching consequences.\nDyson-Schwinger equations have played a critical role in these advances. These\nlecture notes provide an introduction to Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs), QCD\nand hadron physics, and illustrate the use of DSEs to predict phenomena that\nare truly observable.\n","330701":"  We have performed cosmological N-body simulations which include the effect of\nthe masses of the individual neutrino species. The simulations were aimed at\nstudying the effect of different neutrino hierarchies on the matter power\nspectrum. Compared to the linear theory predictions, we find that\nnon-linearities enhance the effect of hierarchy on the matter power spectrum at\nmildly non-linear scales. The difference between the different hierarchies is\nabout 0.5% for a sum of neutrino masses of 0.1eV. Albeit this is a small\neffect, it is potentially measurable from upcoming surveys. In combination with\nneutrinoless double-beta decay experiments, this opens up the possibility of\nusing the sky to determine if neutrinos are Majorana or Dirac fermions.\n","330702":"  We investigate the phase structure of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model at zero\ntemperature, allowing for a two-dimensional spatial dependence of the chiral\ncondensate. Applying the mean-field approximation, we consider various periodic\nstructures with rectangular and hexagonal geometries, and minimize the\ncorresponding free energy. We find that these two-dimensional chiral crystals\nare favored over homogeneous phases in a certain window in the region where the\nphase transition would take place when the analysis was restricted to\nhomogeneous condensates. It turns out, however, that in this regime they are\ndisfavored against a phase with a one-dimensional modulation of the chiral\ncondensate. On the other hand, we find that square and hexagonal lattices\neventually get favored at higher chemical potentials. Although stretching the\nlimits of the model to some extent, this would support predictions from\nquarkyonic-matter studies.\n","330703":"  We predict that a photonic crystal fiber whose strands are filled with a\ndefocusing nonlinear medium can support stable bright and also vortex solitons\nif the strength of the defocusing nonlinearity grows toward the periphery of\nthe fiber. The domains of soliton existence depend on the transverse growth\nrate of the filling nonlinearity and nonlinearity of the core. Remarkably,\nsolitons exist even when the core material is linear.\n","330704":"  This paper is concerned with the study of solutions to discrete parabolic\nequations in divergence form with random coefficients, and their convergence to\nsolutions of a homogenized equation. It has previously been shown that if the\nrandom environment is translational invariant and ergodic, then solutions of\nthe random equation converge under diffusive scaling to solutions of a\nhomogenized parabolic PDE. In this paper point-wise estimates are obtained on\nthe difference between the averaged solution to the random equation and the\nsolution to the homogenized equation for certain random environments which are\nstrongly mixing.\n","330705":"  To investigate interactions between parasite species in a host, a population\nof field voles was studied longitudinally, with presence or absence of six\ndifferent parasites measured repeatedly. Although trapping sessions were\nregular, a different set of voles was caught at each session leading to\nincomplete profiles for all subjects. We use a discrete-time hidden Markov\nmodel for each disease with transition probabilities dependent on covariates\nvia a set of logistic regressions. For each disease the hidden states for each\nof the other diseases at a given time point form part of the covariate set for\nthe Markov transition probabilities from that time point. This allows us to\ngauge the influence of each parasite species on the transition probabilities\nfor each of the other parasite species. Inference is performed via a Gibbs\nsampler, which cycles through each of the diseases, first using an adaptive\nMetropolis-Hastings step to sample from the conditional posterior of the\ncovariate parameters for that particular disease given the hidden states for\nall other diseases and then sampling from the hidden states for that disease\ngiven the parameters. We find evidence for interactions between several pairs\nof parasites and of an acquired immune response for two of the parasites.\n","330706":"  The focus of this work is to demonstrate how spatially resolved image\ninformation from diesel fuel injection events can be obtained using a\nforward-scatter imaging geometry, and used to calculate the velocities of\nliquid structures on the periphery of the spray. In order to obtain accurate\nvelocities directly from individual diesel spray structures, those features\nneed to be spatially resolved in the measurement. The distributed structures\nmeasured in a direct shadowgraphy arrangement cannot be reliably analyzed for\nthis kind of velocity information. However, by utilizing an intense collimated\nlight source and adding imaging optics which modify the signal collection,\nspatially resolved optical information can be retrieved from spray edge regions\nwithin a chosen object plane. This work discusses a set of measurements where a\ndiesel spray is illuminated in rapid succession by two ultrafast laser pulses\ngenerated by a mode-locked Ti-Sapphire oscillator seeding a matched pair of\nregenerative amplifiers. Light from the object plane, located at the center of\nthe spray, is directed by a set of imaging optics to the detection plane, where\nit forms a shadow image on the face of a frame-transfer CCD. In this\nconfiguration the depth-of-field of the imaging optics limit detected light,\neffectively increasing the efficiency of signal collection within the object\nplane and suppressing out-of-focus contributions. Time-correlated images are\ncollected in this manner and analyzed to obtain object plane velocity data for\nin-focus edge features of the spray.\n","330707":"  We investigate Whitehead's asphericity question from a new perspective, using\nresults and techniques of the homotopy theory of finite topological spaces. We\nalso introduce a method of reduction to investigate asphericity based on the\ninteraction between the combinatorics and the topology of finite spaces.\n","330708":"  This document shows the detailed specification of LOCKE coherence protocol\nfor each cache controller, using a table-based technique. This representation\nprovides clear, concise visual information yet includes sufficient detail\n(e.g., transient states) arguably lacking in the traditional, graphical form of\nstate diagrams.\n","330709":"  We present an approach to generalization of practical Identity-Based\nEncryption scheme of Boneh and Franklin. In particular we show how the protocol\ncould be used on finite modular lattices and as a special case on vector spaces\nover finite field. The original proof of security for this protocol does not\nhold in this general algebraic structure, thus this is still a work in\nprogress.\n","330710":"  Network modeling plays a critical role in identifying statistical\nregularities and structural principles common to many systems. The large\nmajority of recent modeling approaches are connectivity driven. The structural\npatterns of the network are at the basis of the mechanisms ruling the network\nformation. Connectivity driven models necessarily provide a time-aggregated\nrepresentation that may fail to describe the instantaneous and fluctuating\ndynamics of many networks. We address this challenge by defining the activity\npotential, a time invariant function characterizing the agents' interactions\nand constructing an activity driven model capable of encoding the instantaneous\ntime description of the network dynamics. The model provides an explanation of\nstructural features such as the presence of hubs, which simply originate from\nthe heterogeneous activity of agents. Within this framework, highly dynamical\nnetworks can be described analytically, allowing a quantitative discussion of\nthe biases induced by the time-aggregated representations in the analysis of\ndynamical processes.\n","330711":"  We classify, up to conjugacy, the finite (constant) subgroups G of adjoint\nabsolutely simple algebraic groups of type $A_1$ over an arbitrary field $k$ of\ncharacteristic not 2.\n","330712":"  We resolve an open question by determining matching (asymptotic) upper and\nlower bounds on the state complexity of the operation that sends a language L\nto (c(L*))*, where c() denotes complement.\n","330713":"  Examining phase stabilities and phase equilibria in strongly correlated\nmaterials asks for a next level in the many-body extensions to the\nlocal-density approximation (LDA) beyond mainly spectroscopic assessments. Here\nwe put the charge-self-consistent LDA+dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT)\nmethodology based on projected local orbitals for the LDA+DMFT interface and a\ntailored pseudopotential framework into action in order to address such\nthermodynamics of realistic strongly correlated systems. Namely a case study\nfor the electronic phase diagram of the well-known prototype Mott-phenomena\nsystem V$_2$O$_3$ at higher temperatures is presented. We are able to describe\nthe first-order metal-to-insulator transitions with negative pressure and\ntemperature from the self-consistent computation of the correlated total energy\nin line with experimental findings.\n","330714":"  Recently, in arXiv:1105.2298 [hep-th], we have estimated the energy radiated\nin the head-on collision of two equal D-dimensional Aichelburg-Sexl shock\nwaves, for even D, by solving perturbatively, to first order, the Einstein\nequations in the future of the collision. Here, we report on the solution for\nthe odd D case. After finding the wave forms, we extract the estimated radiated\nenergy for D=5,7,9 and 11 and unveil a remarkably simple pattern, given the\ncomplexity of the framework: (for all D) the estimated fraction of radiated\nenergy matches the analytic expression 1\/2-1\/D, within the numerical error\n(less than 0.1%). Both this fit and the apparent horizon bound converge to 1\/2\nas D goes to infinity.\n","330715":"  We have investigated the 2009 July impact event on Jupiter using the ZEUS-MP\n2 three-dimensional hydrodynamics code. We studied the impact itself and the\nfollowing plume development. Eight impactors were considered: 0.5 km and 1 km\nporous (\\rho = 1.760 g cm^{-3}) and non-porous (\\rho = 2.700 g cm^{-3}) basalt\nimpactors, and 0.5 km and 1 km porous (\\rho = 0.600 g cm^{-3}) and non-porous\n\\rho = 0.917 g cm^{-3}) ice impactors. The simulations consisted of these\nbolides colliding with Jupiter at an incident angle of \\theta = 69 degrees from\nthe vertical and with an impact velocity of v = 61.4 km s^{-1}. Our simulations\nshow the development of relatively larger, faster plumes created after impacts\ninvolving 1 km diameter bodies. Comparing simulations of the 2009 event with\nsimulations of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 events reveals a difference in plume\ndevelopment, with the higher incident angle of the 2009 impact leading to a\nshallower terminal depth and a smaller and slower plume. We also studied the\namount of dynamical chaos present in the simulations conducted at the 2009\nincident angle. Compared to the chaos of the SL9 simulations, where \\theta is\napproximately 45 degrees, we find no significant difference in chaos at the\nhigher 2009 incident angle.\n","330716":"  We develop a model for parametric amplification, based on a density matrix\napproach, which naturally accounts for the peculiarities arising for matter\nwaves: significant depletion and explicit time-dependence of the source state\npopulation, long interaction times, and spatial dynamics of the amplified\nmodes. We apply our model to explain the details in an experimental study on\ntwin-atom beam emission from a one-dimensional degenerate Bose gas.\n","330717":"  We compute coherent presentations of Artin monoids, that is presentations by\ngenerators, relations, and relations between the relations. For that, we use\nmethods of higher-dimensional rewriting that extend Squier's and Knuth-Bendix's\ncompletions into a homotopical completion-reduction, applied to Artin's and\nGarside's presentations. The main result of the paper states that the so-called\nTits-Zamolodchikov 3-cells extend Artin's presentation into a coherent\npresentation. As a byproduct, we give a new constructive proof of a theorem of\nDeligne on the actions of an Artin monoid on a category.\n","330718":"  Squeezed states, a special kind of entangled states, are known as a useful\nresource for quantum metrology. In interferometric sensors they allow to\novercome the \"classical\" projection noise limit stemming from the independent\nnature of the individual photons or atoms within the interferometer. Motivated\nby the potential impact on metrology as wells as by fundamental questions in\nthe context of entanglement, a lot of theoretical and experimental effort has\nbeen made to study squeezed states. The first squeezed states useful for\nquantum enhanced metrology have been proposed and generated in quantum optics,\nwhere the squeezed variables are the coherences of the light field. In this\ntutorial we focus on spin squeezing in atomic systems. We give an introduction\nto its concepts and discuss its generation in Bose-Einstein condensates. We\ndiscuss in detail the experimental requirements necessary for the generation\nand direct detection of coherent spin squeezing. Two exemplary experiments\ndemonstrating adiabatically prepared spin squeezing based on motional degrees\nof freedom and diabatically realized spin squeezing based on internal hyperfine\ndegrees of freedom are discussed.\n","330719":"  We present two-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\nline-tied asymmetric magnetic reconnection in the context of solar flare and\ncoronal mass ejection current sheets. The reconnection process is made\nasymmetric along the inflow direction by allowing the initial upstream magnetic\nfield strengths and densities to differ, and along the outflow direction by\nplacing the initial perturbation near a conducting wall boundary that\nrepresents the photosphere. When the upstream magnetic fields are asymmetric,\nthe post-flare loop structure is distorted into a characteristic skewed candle\nflame shape. The simulations can thus be used to provide constraints on the\nreconnection asymmetry in post-flare loops. More hard X-ray emission is\nexpected to occur at the footpoint on the weak magnetic field side because\nenergetic particles are more likely to escape the magnetic mirror there than at\nthe strong magnetic field footpoint. The footpoint on the weak magnetic field\nside is predicted to move more quickly because of the requirement in two\ndimensions that equal amounts of flux must be reconnected from each upstream\nregion. The X-line drifts away from the conducting wall in all simulations with\nasymmetric outflow and into the strong magnetic field region during most of the\nsimulations with asymmetric inflow. There is net plasma flow across the X-line\nfor both the inflow and outflow directions. The reconnection exhaust directed\naway from the obstructing wall is significantly faster than the exhaust\ndirected towards it. The asymmetric inflow condition allows net vorticity in\nthe rising outflow plasmoid which would appear as rolling motions about the\nflux rope axis.\n","330720":"  Using the data for 24.5x10^6 psi(2S) produced in e^+e^- annihilations at\nsqrt{s}=3686 MeV at the CESR-c e^+e^- collider and 8.6x10^6 J\/psi produced in\nthe decay psi(2S)->pi^+pi^-J\/psi, the branching fractions for psi(2S) and J\/psi\ndecays to pairs of pseudoscalar mesons, pi^+pi^-, K^+K^-, and K_S K_L, have\nbeen measured using the CLEO-c detector. We obtain branching fractions\nBr(psi(2S)->pi^+pi^-)=(7.6+-2.5+-0.6)x10^-6,\nBr(psi(2S)->K^+K^-)=(74.8+-2.3+-3.9)x10^-6, Br(psi(2S)->K_S\nK_L)=(52.8+-2.5+-3.4)x10^-6, and Br(J\/psi->pi^+pi^-)=(1.47+-0.13+-0.13)x10^-4,\nBr(J\/psi->K^+K^-)=(2.86+-0.09+-0.19)x10^-4, Br(J\/psi+-K_S\nK_L)=(2.62+-0.15+-0.14)x10^-4, where the first errors are statistical and the\nsecond errors are systematic. The phase differences between the amplitudes for\nelectromagnetic and strong decays of psi(2S) and J\/psi to 0^{-+} pseudoscalar\npairs are determined by a Monte Carlo method to be\n\\delta(psi(2S)_{PP}=(110.5^{+16.0}_{-9.5})^o and\n\\delta(J\/psi)_{PP}=(73.5^{+5.0}_{-4.5})^o. The difference between the two is\n\\Delta\\delta = \\delta(psi(2S))_{PP}-\\delta(J\/psi)_{PP}\n=(37.0^{+16.5}_{-10.5})^o.\n","330721":"  It is well known that opportunistic scheduling algorithms are throughput\noptimal under full knowledge of channel and network conditions. However, these\nalgorithms achieve a hypothetical achievable rate region which does not take\ninto account the overhead associated with channel probing and feedback required\nto obtain the full channel state information at every slot. We adopt a channel\nprobing model where $\\beta$ fraction of time slot is consumed for acquiring the\nchannel state information (CSI) of a single channel. In this work, we design a\njoint scheduling and channel probing algorithm named SDF by considering the\noverhead of obtaining the channel state information. We first analytically\nprove SDF algorithm can support $1+\\epsilon$ fraction of of the full rate\nregion achieved when all users are probed where $\\epsilon$ depends on the\nexpected number of users which are not probed. Then, for homogenous channel, we\nshow that when the number of users in the network is greater than 3, $\\epsilon\n> 0$, i.e., we guarantee to expand the rate region. In addition, for\nheterogenous channels, we prove the conditions under which SDF guarantees to\nincrease the rate region. We also demonstrate numerically in a realistic\nsimulation setting that this rate region can be achieved by probing only less\nthan 50% of all channels in a CDMA based cellular network utilizing high data\nrate protocol under normal channel conditions.\n","330722":"  We assess experimentally the suitability of coupled transmission line\nresonators for studies of quantum phase transitions of light. We have measured\ndevices with low photon hopping rates t\/2pi = 0.8MHz to quantify disorder in\nindividual cavity frequencies. The observed disorder is consistent with small\nimperfections in fabrication. We studied the dependence of the disorder on\ntransmission line geometry and used our results to fabricate devices with\ndisorder less than two parts in 10^4. The normal mode spectrum of devices with\na high photon hopping rate t\/2pi = 31MHz shows little effect of disorder,\nrendering resonator arrays a good backbone for the study of condensed matter\nphysics with photons.\n","330723":"  Let $G=Sp_{2n}(\\mathbb{C})$, and $\\mathfrak{N}$ be Kato's exotic nilpotent\ncone. Following techniques used by Bezrukavnikov in [5] to establish a\nbijection between $\\Lambda^+$, the dominant weights for a simple algebraic\ngroup $H$, and $\\textbf{O}$, the set of pairs consisting of a nilpotent orbit\nand a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of the isotropy group of\nthe orbit, we prove an analogous statement for the exotic nilpotent cone. First\nwe prove that dominant line bundles on the exotic Springer resolution\n$\\widetilde{\\mathfrak{N}}$ have vanishing higher cohomology, and compute their\nglobal sections using techniques of Broer. This allows to show that the direct\nimages of these dominant line bundles constitute a quasi-exceptional set\ngenerating the category $D^b(Coh^G(\\mathfrak{N}))$, and deduce that the\nresulting $t$-structure on $D^b(Coh^G(\\mathfrak{N}))$ coincides with the\nperverse coherent $t$-structure. The desired result now follows from the\nbijection between costandard objects and simple objects in the heart of this\n$t$-structure on $D^b(Coh^G(\\mathfrak{N}))$.\n","330724":"  We demonstrate that the broadband nonlinear optical response of graphene can\nbe resonantly enhanced by more than an order of magnitude through hybridization\nwith a plasmonic metamaterial,while retaining an ultrafast nonlinear response\ntime of ~1 ps. Transmission modulation close to ~1% is seen at a pump uence of\n~0.03 mJ\/cm^2 at the wavelength of ~1600 nm. This approach allows to engineer\nand enhance graphene's nonlinearity within a broad wavelength range enabling\napplications in optical switching, mode-locking and pulse shaping.\n","330725":"  To expand the framework available for interpreting experiments on disordered\nstrongly correlated systems, and in particular to explore further the\nstrong-coupling zero-bias anomaly found in the Anderson-Hubbard model, we ask\nhow this anomaly responds to the addition of nonlocal electron-electron\ninteractions. We use exact diagonalization to calculate the single-particle\ndensity of states of the extended Anderson-Hubbard model. We find that for weak\nnonlocal interactions the form of the zero-bias anomaly is qualitatively\nunchanged. The energy scale of the anomaly continues to be set by an effective\nhopping amplitude renormalized by the nonlocal interaction. At larger values of\nthe nonlocal interaction strength, however, hopping ceases to be a relevant\nenergy scale and higher energy features associated with charge correlations\ndominate the density of states.\n","330726":"  Quantum graphity offers the intriguing notion that space emerges in the low\nenergy states of the spatial degrees of freedom of a dynamical lattice. Here we\ninvestigate metastable domain structures which are likely to exist in the low\nenergy phase of lattice evolution. Through an annealing process we explore the\nformation of metastable defects at domain boundaries and the effects of domain\nstructures on the propagation of bosons. We show that these structures should\nhave observable background independent consequences including scattering,\ndouble imaging, and gravitational lensing-like effects.\n","330727":"  In analogy to the Coulomb and the Pauli spin blockade, based on the\nelectrostatic repulsion and the Pauli exclusion principle respectively, the\nconcept of valley blockade in Silicon nanostructures is explored. The valley\nparity operator is defined. Valley blockade is determined by the parity\nconservation of valley composition eigenvectors in quantum transport. A Silicon\nquantum changeover switch based on a triple of donor quantum dots capable to\nseparate electrons having opposite valley parity by virtue of the valley parity\nconservation is proposed.

These stripe patterns roughen with the appearance of\nnumerous loop domains through thermal annealing just below Tc, but the stripe\ndomain patterns turn to vortex-antivortex domain patterns through a freezing\nprocess when crystals cross Tc even though the phase transition appears not to\nbe Kosterlitz-Thouless-type.

Pseudobulges are\npresumed to develop overtime as a result of secular evolution of galaxy discs.\nWe report simulations of galaxy formation, in which two disc galaxies with\ndisky pseudobulges have formed. Based on the profile decomposition, the\nbulge-to-total mass ratio of the simulated galaxies is 0.6 for one galaxy and\n0.3 for the other. We find that the main formation mechanism of the\npseudobulges in our simulations is not the secular evolution of discs but\nhigh-redshift starbursts. The progenitors of the pseudobulges form as\nhigh-redshift discs with small scale lengths by rapid supply of low angular\nmomentum gas. By redshift 2, before the main disc formation, pseudobulge\nformation has largely completed in terms of mass. The secular evolution such as\nbar instability accounts for about 30 % of the bulge mass for one galaxy and\nonly 13 % for the other but does affect the final shape and kinematic\nproperties of the pseudobulges.\n","330732":"  Quantum Lyapunov control was developed in order to transform a quantum system\nfrom arbitrary initial states to a target state. The idea is to find control\nfields that steer the Lyapunov function to zero as $t\\rightarrow \\infty$,\nmeanwhile the quantum system is driven to the target state. In order to shorten\nthe time required to reach the target state, we propose two designs to optimize\nLyapunov control in this paper. The first design makes the Lyapunov function\ndecrease as fast as possible with a constraint on the total power of control\nfields, and the second design has the same purpose but with a constraint on\neach control field. Examples of a three-level system demonstrate that the\nevolution time for Lyapunov control can be significantly shortened, especially\nwhen high control fidelity is required. Besides, this optimal Lyapunov-based\nquantum control is robust against uncertainties in the free Hamiltonian and\ndecoherence in the system compared to conventional Lyapunov control.\n","330733":"  Here we initiate an investigation of the equational classes of m-symmetric\nalgebras endowed with two tense operators. These varieties is a generalization\nof tense algebras. Our main interest is the duality theory for these classes of\nalgebras.

This is mainly because the range space of the covariance\noperator always is strictly smaller than the Hilbert space. For the Fisher\ninformation to be well-defined, it is furthermore required that the range space\nof the Jacobian is contained in the Cameron-Martin space. In order for this\ncondition to hold and for the Fisher information to be trace class, a\nsufficient condition is formulated based on the singular values of the Jacobian\nas well as of the eigenvalues of the covariance operator, together with some\nregularity assumptions regarding their relative rate of convergence.

Previous work has established a relation between\nlinear event ordering and nested knowledge, and between simultaneous event\noccurrences and common knowledge. In the new, extended, formalism, epistemic\nnecessity is decoupled from temporal necessity. Nested knowledge and event\nordering are shown to be related even when the nesting order does not match the\ntemporal order of occurrence.

Our study has revealed a few universal features of\nnon-perturbative dynamical control irrespective of the types of environments\nand system-environment couplings.

An important implication of the non-perturbative\napproach is its flexibility in implementing the dynamical control scheme in a\nexperimental setup. Our findings have exhibited several interesting features of\nthe non-perturbative regimes such as the chain-size independence, pulse\nstrength upper-bound, noncontinuous valid parameter regions, etc. Furthermore,\nwe find that our non-perturbative scheme is robust against randomness in model\nfabrication and time-dependent random noise.\n","330760":"  The distance dependence and atomic-scale contrast observed in nominal contact\npotential difference (CPD) signals recorded by KPFM on surfaces of insulating\nand semiconducting samples, have stimulated theoretical attempts to explain\nsuch effects. We attack this problem in two steps. First, the electrostatics of\nthe macroscopic tip-cantilever-sample system is treated by a finite-difference\nmethod on an adjustable nonuniform mesh. Then the resulting electric field\nunder the tip apex is inserted into a series of atomistic wavelet-based density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations. Results are shown for a realistic neutral\nbut reactive silicon nano-scale tip interacting with a NaCl(001) sample.\nBias-dependent forces and resulting atomic displacements are computed to within\nan unprecedented accuracy. Theoretical expressions for amplitude modulation\n(AM) and frequency modulation (FM) KPFM signals and for the corresponding local\ncontact potential differences (LCPD) are obtained by combining the macroscopic\nand atomistic contributions to the electrostatic force component generated at\nthe voltage modulation frequency, and evaluated for several tip oscillation\namplitudes A up to 10 nm. Being essentially constant over a few Volts, the\nslope of atomistic force versus bias is the basic quantity which determines\nvariations of the atomic-scale LCPD contrast. Already above A = 0.1 nm, the\nLCPD contrasts in both modes exhibit almost the same spatial dependence as the\nslope. In the AM mode, this contrast is approximately proportional to\n$A^{-1\/2}$, but remains much weaker than the contrast in the FM mode, which\ndrops somewhat faster as A is increased. These trends are a consequence of the\nmacroscopic contributions to the KPFM signal, which are stronger in the AM-mode\nand especially important if the sample is an insulator even at sub-nanometer\nseparations where atomic-scale contrast appears.\n","330761":"  In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining the best $k$-sparse\nsolution of $Ax=y$ subject to the constraint that the columns of $A$ are\northogonal.

Another application is to deduce the monotonicity\nformulae for volumes of minimal submanifolds in some outer spaces with suitable\nexhaustion functions. In this way, we recapture the classical volume\nmonotonicity formulae of minimal submanifolds in Euclidean spaces. We also\napply the vanishing theorems to Bernstein type problem of submanifolds in\nEuclidean spaces with parallel mean curvature. In particular, we may obtain\nBernstein type results for minimal submanifolds, especially for minimal real\nK\\\"ahler submanifolds under weaker conditions.\n","330771":"  A set of gauge invariants are identified for the gauge theory of quantum\nanholonomies, which comprise both the Berry phase and an exotic anholonomy in\neigenspaces.

Finally, assuming the Riemann\nHypothesis, we give estimations of the best possible $r_3$ such that, for $n\\ge\nr_3$, we have $p_n> s_3(n)$ where $s_3(n)$ is the sum of the first four terms\nof the asymptotic expansion.\n","330773":"  Motivated by its relation to the length of cutting plane proofs for the\nMaximum Biclique problem, we consider the following communication game on a\ngiven graph G, known to both players. Let K be the maximal number of vertices\nin a complete bipartite subgraph of G, which is not necessarily an induced\nsubgraph if G is not bipartite. Alice gets a set A of vertices, and Bob gets a\ndisjoint set B of vertices such that |A|+|B|>K. The goal is to find a nonedge\nof G between A and B.

Inspired by ant colony optimization, we propose a novel collaborative\nfiltering scheme: Ant Collaborative Filtering that enjoys those favorable\ncharacteristics above mentioned. With the mechanism of pheromone transmission\nbetween users and items, our method can pinpoint most relative users and items\neven in face of the sparsity problem. By virtue of the evaporation of existing\npheromone, we capture the evolution of user preference over time. Meanwhile,\nthe computation complexity is comparatively small and the incremental update\ncan be done online. We design three experiments on three typical recommender\nsystems, namely movie recommendation, book recommendation and music\nrecommendation, which cover both explicit and implicit rating data.

The theoretical prediction is obtained\nusing NLO QCD, and it also includes non-perturbative corrections. Our\ndetermination uses inputs with transverse momenta between 45 and 600 GeV, the\nrunning of the strong coupling being also tested in this range.

Dynamic equation of motion has been solved for a\nsimple cubic lattice ($q=6$) by utilizing a Glauber type stochastic process.\nAmplitude of the sinusoidally oscillating magnetic field is randomly\ndistributed on the lattice sites according to bimodal and trimodal distribution\nfunctions. For a bimodal type of amplitude distribution, it is found in the\nhigh frequency regime that the dynamic phase diagrams of the system in\ntemperature versus field amplitude plane resemble the corresponding phase\ndiagrams of pure kinetic Ising model. Our numerical results indicate that for a\nbimodal distribution, both in the low and high frequency regimes, the dynamic\nphase diagrams always exhibit a coexistence region in which the stationary\nstate (ferro or para) of the system is completely dependent on the initial\nconditions whereas for a trimodal distribution, coexistence region disappears\ndepending on the values of system parameters.\n","330779":"  This letter reports on a search for hypothetical heavy neutrinos, N, and\nright-handed gauge bosons, WR, in events with two high transverse momentum\nleptons and at least one high transverse momentum hadronic jet.

No excess above the Standard Model\nbackground expectation is observed. Excluded mass regions for Majorana and\nDirac neutrinos are presented using two approaches for interactions that\nviolate lepton and lepton-flavour numbers. One approach uses an effective\noperator framework, the other approach is guided by the Left-Right Symmetric\nModel.

This defect is produced by a spherically symmetric\ndislocation, or ball dislocation. We derive the induced metric as well as the\naffine connections and curvature tensors. Since the induced metric is\ndiscontinuous, one can expect ambiguity coming from these quantities, due to\nproducts between delta functions or its derivatives, plaguing a description of\nball dislocations based on the Geometric Theory of Defects. However, exactly as\nin the previous case of cylindric defect, one can obtain some well-defined\nphysical predictions of the induced geometry. In particular, we explore some\nproperties of test particle trajectories around the defect and show that these\ntrajectories are curved but can not be circular orbits.\n","330781":"  We study distribution free, nonparametric prediction bands with a special\nfocus on their finite sample behavior.

The proposed\nestimator, called COPS (Conformal Optimized Prediction Set), always has finite\nsample guarantee in a stronger sense than the original conformal prediction\nestimator. Under regularity conditions the estimator converges to an oracle\nband at a minimax optimal rate. A fast approximation algorithm and a data\ndriven method for selecting the bandwidth are developed. The method is\nillustrated first in simulated data.

A simple\nexample is the classic problem, first considered by Berg and Purcell, of\ndetermining the concentration of a chemical ligand in the surrounding media. On\ngeneral theoretical grounds (Landuer's Principle), it is expected that such\ncomputations require cells to consume energy. Here, we explicitly calculate the\nenergetic costs of computing ligand concentration for a simple two-component\ncellular network that implements a noisy version of the Berg-Purcell strategy.\nWe show that learning about external concentrations necessitates the breaking\nof detailed balance and consumption of energy, with greater learning requiring\nmore energy.

We then compare Langevin dynamics\nintegrators in terms of their invariant distributions and demonstrate a\nsuperconvergence property (4th order accuracy where only 2nd order would be\nexpected) of one method in the high friction limit; this method, moreover, can\nbe reduced to a simple modification of the Euler-Maruyama method for Brownian\ndynamics involving a non-Markovian (coloured noise) random process. In the\nBrownian dynamics case, 2nd order accuracy of the invariant density is\nachieved. All methods considered are efficient for molecular applications\n(requiring one force evaluation per timestep) and of a simple form.

We present infrared images taken with Herschel and Spitzer using 11\ndifferent broad-band filters between 3.6 um and 500 um. We compare the\nmorphology of the emission using cuts along different position angles. We\nconstruct spectral energy distributions, which we compare to different dust\nmodels, and calculate dust temperatures. We also derive opacity maps and\nanalyze the density structure of the environment of HD 97300.\n  Results. We find that HD 97300 has no infrared excess at or below 24 um,\nconfirming its zero-age main-sequence nature. The morphology of the ring is\nvery similar between 3.6 um and 24 um. The emission at these wavelengths is\ndominated by either PAH features or PAH continuum. At longer wavelengths, only\nthe northwestern part of the ring is visible. A fit to the 100-500 um\nobservations suggests that the emission is due to relatively warm (~26 K) dust.\nThe temperature gradually decreases with increasing distance from the ring. We\nfind a general decrease in the density from north to south, and an approximate\n10% density increase in the northeastern part of the ring.\n  Conclusions.

This contrasts\nwith the $\\Omega(n)$ lower bound established by the classical result of Dinur\nand Nissim [PODS 2003] for arbitrary subset counting queries. We also show a\nmatching lower bound on average squared error for any $(\\epsilon,\n\\delta)$-differentially private algorithm for halfspace counting. Both bounds\nare obtained using discrepancy theory. For the lower bound, we use a modified\ndiscrepancy measure and bound approximation of $(\\epsilon,\n\\delta)$-differentially private algorithms for range counting queries in terms\nof this discrepancy. We also relate the modified discrepancy measure to\nclassical combinatorial discrepancy, which allows us to exploit known\ndiscrepancy lower bounds.

For the integrable Hamiltonian systems given by the vector field\n$v=(-\\partial f\/\\partial w, \\partial f\/\\partial z)$ on ${\\mathbb C}^2$ where\n$f=f(z,w)$ is a complex polynomial in 2 variables, geometric properties of\nLiouville fibrations are described.\n","330815":"  We prove the relative index conjecture, which in turn implies that the set of\nembeddable deformations of a strictly pseudoconvex CR-structure on a compact\n3-manifold is closed in the C\\infty-topology.\n","330816":"  We give a new construction of the one-variable Alexander polynomial of an\noriented knot or link, and show that it generalizes to a vector valued\ninvariant of oriented tangles.\n","330817":"  Quantum Monte Carlo methods provide in principle an accurate treatment of the\nmany-body problem of the ground and excited states of condensed systems. In\npractice, however, uncontrolled errors such as those arising from the\nfixed-node and pseudopotential approximations often limit the quality of\nresults. We show that the accuracy of quantum Monte Carlo calculations is\nlimited by using available pseudopotentials. In particular, it is necessary to\ninclude angular momentum channels in the pseudopotential for excited angular\nmomentum states and to choose the local channel appropriately to obtain\naccurate results. Variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations for Zn, O,\nand Si atoms and ions demonstrate that these issues can affect total energies\nby up to several eV for common pseudopotentials. Adding higher-angular momentum\nchannels into the pseudopotential description reduces such errors drastically\nwithout a significant increase in computational cost.\n","330818":"  In 1982, L.

In order to do this, we requiere\nEsakia's duality for Heyting algebras and Goldblatt's duality for bounded\ndistributive lattices with operations.\n","330819":"  We study a viscous two-layer quasi-geostrophic beta-plane model that is\nforced by imposition of a spatially uniform vertical shear in the eastward\n(zonal) component of the layer flows, or equivalently a spatially uniform\nnorth-south temperature gradient. We prove that the model is linearly unstable,\nbut that non-linear solutions are bounded in time by a bound which is\nindependent of the initial data and is determined only by the physical\nparameters of the model. We further prove, using arguments first presented in\nthe study of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the existence of an absorbing\nball in appropriate function spaces, and in fact the existence of a compact\nfinite-dimensional attractor, and provide upper bounds for the fractal and\nHausdorff dimensions of the attractor. Finally, we show the existence of an\ninertial manifold for the dynamical system generated by the model's solution\noperator.

At low Q2 and at large\nenergy the data exhibit a strong excess, up to about 100%, above the twist 2\nNLO DGLAP description. The excess in consistent with higher twist effects. It\nis found, that complementing the DGLAP fit by twist 4 and 6 components of the\nGBW saturation model leads to a good description of data at low Q2. We conclude\nthat the DDIS at HERA provides the first, strong evidence of higher twist\neffects in DIS.\n","330821":"  For any Hermitian Lie group G of tube type we construct a Fock model of its\nminimal representation. The Fock space is defined on the minimal nilpotent\nK_C-orbit X in p_C and the L^2-inner product involves a K-Bessel function as\ndensity. Here K is a maximal compact subgroup of G, and g_C=k_C+p_C is a\ncomplexified Cartan decomposition. In this realization the space of k-finite\nvectors consists of holomorphic polynomials on X. The reproducing kernel of the\nFock space is calculated explicitly in terms of an I-Bessel function. We\nfurther find an explicit formula of a generalized Segal-Bargmann transform\nwhich intertwines the Schroedinger and Fock model. Its kernel involves the same\nI-Bessel function. Using the Segal--Bargmann transform we also determine the\nintegral kernel of the unitary inversion operator in the Schroedinger model\nwhich is given by a J-Bessel function.\n","330822":"  The local spin polarisation (LSP) of electrons in two typical semiconductor\nnanowires under the modulation of Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is\ninvestigated theoretically. The influence of both the SOI- and\nstructure-induced bound states on the LSP is taken into account via the\nspin-resolved lattice Green function method. It is discovered that high\nspin-density islands with alternative signs of polarisation are formed inside\nthe nanowires due to the interaction between the bound states and the Rashba\neffective magnetic field. Further study shows that the spin-density islands\ncaused by the structure-induced bound state exhibit a strong robustness against\ndisorder. These findings may provide an efficient way to create local magnetic\nmoments and store information in semiconductors.\n","330823":"  Koivisto studied the partitioning of sets of bounded cardinality.

The charge and spin conductances are\ncalculated as function of the electron energy or the wire length by adopting\nthe spinresolved lattice Green function method. For a single disordered Rashba\nwire, it is found that the charge conductance quantization is destroyed by the\nedge disorder. However, a nonzero spin conductance can be generated and its\namplitude can be manipulated by the wire length, which is attributed to the\nbroken structure symmetries and the spin-dependent quantum interference induced\nby the rough boundaries. For a large ensemble of disordered Rashba wires, the\naverage charge conductance decreases monotonically, however, the average spin\nconductance increases to a maximum value and then decreases, with increasing\nwire length. Further study shows that the influence of the rough edges on the\ncharge and spin conductances can be eliminated by applying a perpendicular\nmagnetic field to the wire. In addition, a very large magnitude of the spin\nconductance can be achieved when the electron energy lies between the two\nthresholds of each pair of subbands. These findings may not only benefit to\nfurther apprehend the transport properties of the Rashba low-dimensional\nsystems but also provide some theoretical instructions to the application of\nspintronics devices.\n","330826":"  Recently, a colour image encryption algorithm based on chaos was proposed by\ncascading two position permutation operations and one substitution operation,\nwhich are all determined by some pseudo-random number sequences generated by\niterating the Logistic map.

The bond\ndistortion break inversion symmetry and modify the $d$-$p$ hybridization.\nConsequently, it will affect electric polarization which can be divided into\nspin-current part and lattice-mediated part. The spin-current polarization can\nbe written in terms of $\\vec{e}_{i,j}\\times(\\vec{e}_{i}\\times\\vec{e}_{j}) $ and\nthe lattice-mediated polarization exists only when the M-O-M bond is distorted.\nThe electric polarization for three-atom M-O-M and four-atom M-O$_{2}$-M\nclusters is calculated. We also study possible electric ordering in three kinds\nof chains made of different clusters.

SrFeO3 exhibits stable G-type helical order, while A- and\nG-type helical orders in BaFeO3 are almost degenerate at short propagating\nvector with tiny energetic barrier with respect to ferromagnetic spin order,\nexplaining ferromagnetism under small field.

The models we\nconsider are: stratified sampling, the partial linear model, linear and\nquadratic functionals of white noise and estimation with stopping times. We\npresent a strong version of Doob's consistency theorem which demonstrates that\nthe existence of a uniformly $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimator ensures that the\nBayes posterior is $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent for values of the parameter in subsets\nof prior probability 1. We also demonstrate that it is, at least, in principle,\npossible to construct Bayes priors giving both global and local minimax rates,\nusing a suitable combination of loss functions. We argue that there is no\ncontradiction in these apparently conflicting findings.\n","330831":"  A scheme for a spin polarization direction switch is investigated by studying\nthe spin-dependent electron transport of an asymmetrical quantum wire (QW) with\nRashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is found that the magnitude of the\nspin-polarized current in the backward biased case is equal to it in the\nforward biased case but their signs are contrary. This results indicate that\nthe spin polarization direction can be switched by changing the direction of\nthe external current. The physical mechanism of this device may arise from the\nsymmetries in the longitudinal and transverse directions are broken but\n$C_2$-rotation and time-reversal symmetries are still reserved.

The underlying physics\nis revealed to originate from the different spin-dependent conductance caused\nby the effects of Rashba SOC and the geometrical structure of the system.\nFurther study shows that the spin-polarized current with strong a robustness\nagainst disorder, demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed nanostructure\nfor a real application.\n","330833":"  Many social networks, e.g., Slashdot and Twitter, can be represented as\ndirected graphs (digraphs) with two types of links between entities: mutual\n(bi-directional) and one-way (uni-directional) connections. Social science\ntheories reveal that mutual connections are more stable than one-way\nconnections, and one-way connections exhibit various tendencies to become\nmutual connections. It is therefore important to take such tendencies into\naccount when performing clustering of social networks with both mutual and\none-way connections.\n  In this paper, we utilize the dyadic methods to analyze social networks, and\ndevelop a generalized mutuality tendency theory to capture the tendencies of\nthose node pairs which tend to establish mutual connections more frequently\nthan those occur by chance. Using these results, we develop a\nmutuality-tendency-aware spectral clustering algorithm to identify more stable\nclusters by maximizing the within-cluster mutuality tendency and minimizing the\ncross-cluster mutuality tendency. Extensive simulation results on synthetic\ndatasets as well as real online social network datasets such as Slashdot,\ndemonstrate that our proposed mutuality-tendency-aware spectral clustering\nalgorithm extracts more stable social community structures than traditional\nspectral clustering methods.\n","330834":"  Estimating the spectral characteristics of a nonstationary random process is\nan important but challenging task, which can be facilitated by exploiting\nstructural properties of the process. In certain applications, the observed\nprocesses are underspread, i.e., their time and frequency correlations exhibit\na reasonably fast decay, and approximately time-frequency sparse, i.e., a\nreasonably large percentage of the spectral values is small. For this class of\nprocesses, we propose a compressive estimator of the discrete Rihaczek spectrum\n(RS). This estimator combines a minimum variance unbiased estimator of the RS\n(which is a smoothed Rihaczek distribution using an appropriately designed\nsmoothing kernel) with a compressed sensing technique that exploits the\napproximate time-frequency sparsity. As a result of the compression stage, the\nnumber of measurements required for good estimation performance can be\nsignificantly reduced. The measurements are values of the discrete ambiguity\nfunction of the observed signal at randomly chosen time and frequency lag\npositions. We provide bounds on the mean-square estimation error of both the\nminimum variance unbiased RS estimator and the compressive RS estimator, and we\ndemonstrate the performance of the compressive estimator by means of simulation\nresults. The proposed compressive RS estimator can also be used for estimating\nother time-dependent spectra (e.g., the Wigner-Ville spectrum) since for an\nunderspread process most spectra are almost equal.\n","330835":"  We study quantum gravity constraints on inflationary model building. Our\napproach is based on requiring the entropy associated to a given inflationary\nmodel to be less than that of the de Sitter entropy. We give two prescriptions\nfor determining the inflationary entropy, based on either `bits per unit area'\nor entanglement entropy. The existence of transPlanckian flat directions,\nnecessary for large tensor modes in the CMB, correlates with an inflationary\nentropy greater than that allowed by de Sitter space. Independently these\ntechniques also constrain or exclude de Sitter models with large-rank gauge\ngroups and high UV cutoffs, such as racetrack inflation or the KKLT\nconstruction.\n","330836":"  We present the experimental demonstration of a superconducting photon number\nresolving detector.

A vast body of work has studied the sparsity-constrained\noptimization from theoretical, algorithmic, and application aspects in the\ncontext of sparse estimation in linear models where the fidelity of the\nestimate is measured by the squared error. In contrast, relatively less effort\nhas been made in the study of sparsity-constrained optimization in cases where\nnonlinear models are involved or the cost function is not quadratic. In this\npaper we propose a greedy algorithm, Gradient Support Pursuit (GraSP), to\napproximate sparse minima of cost functions of arbitrary form. Should a cost\nfunction have a Stable Restricted Hessian (SRH) or a Stable Restricted\nLinearization (SRL), both of which are introduced in this paper, our algorithm\nis guaranteed to produce a sparse vector within a bounded distance from the\ntrue sparse optimum. Our approach generalizes known results for quadratic cost\nfunctions that arise in sparse linear regression and Compressive Sensing.

The two-dimensional distribution of the\ncolumn density of stored silver dimer cations was measured via\nphotofragment-ion yields as a function of the position of the incident laser\nbeam over the transverse cross section of the trap. The profile of the ion\ndistribution was found to be dependent on the number of loaded ions. Under high\nion-loading conditions with a significant space-charge effect, ions form a ring\nprofile with a maximum at the outer region of the trap, whereas they are\nlocalized near the center axis region at low loading of the ions. These results\nare explained quantitatively by a model calculation based on equilibrium\nbetween the space-charge-induced potential and the effective potential of the\nmultipole rf field. The maximum adiabaticity parameter \\eta_max is estimated to\nbe about 0.13 for the high ion-density condition in the present octopole ion\ntrap, which is lower than typical values reported for low ion densities; this\nis probably due to additional instability caused by the space charge.\n","330844":"  In this paper, we present BlinkDB, a massively parallel, sampling-based\napproximate query engine for running ad-hoc, interactive SQL queries on large\nvolumes of data. The key insight that BlinkDB builds on is that one can often\nmake reasonable decisions in the absence of perfect answers. For example,\nreliably detecting a malfunctioning server using a distributed collection of\nsystem logs does not require analyzing every request processed by the system.\nBased on this insight, BlinkDB allows one to trade-off query accuracy for\nresponse time, enabling interactive queries over massive data by running\nqueries on data samples and presenting results annotated with meaningful error\nbars. To achieve this, BlinkDB uses two key ideas that differentiate it from\nprevious work in this area: (1) an adaptive optimization framework that builds\nand maintains a set of multi-dimensional, multi-resolution samples from\noriginal data over time, and (2) a dynamic sample selection strategy that\nselects an appropriately sized sample based on a query's accuracy and\/or\nresponse time requirements. We have built an open-source version of BlinkDB and\nvalidated its effectiveness using the well-known TPC-H benchmark as well as a\nreal-world analytic workload derived from Conviva Inc. Our experiments on a 100\nnode cluster show that BlinkDB can answer a wide range of queries from a\nreal-world query trace on up to 17 TBs of data in less than 2 seconds (over\n100\\times faster than Hive), within an error of 2 - 10%.\n","330845":"  The Milky Way Project citizen science initiative recently increased the\nnumber of known infrared bubbles in the inner Galactic plane by an order of\nmagnitude compared to previous studies. We present a detailed statistical\nanalysis of this dataset with the Red MSX Source catalog of massive young\nstellar sources to investigate the association of these bubbles with massive\nstar formation. We particularly address the question of massive triggered star\nformation near infrared bubbles. We find a strong positional correlation of\nmassive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and H II regions with Milky Way Project\nbubbles at separations of < 2 bubble radii. As bubble sizes increase, a\nstatistically significant overdensity of massive young sources emerges in the\nregion of the bubble rims, possibly indicating the occurrence of triggered star\nformation. Based on numbers of bubble-associated RMS sources we find that\n67+\/-3% of MYSOs and (ultra)compact H II regions appear associated with a\nbubble. We estimate that approximately 22+\/-2% of massive young stars may have\nformed as a result of feedback from expanding H II regions.

This object was reported to show no X-ray absorption\nin the low-spatial resolution ASCA data. The XMM observations show that the\nX-ray emission of NGC 7590 is dominated by an off-nuclear ultra-luminous X-ray\nsource (ULX) and an extended emission from the host galaxy, and the nucleus is\nrather weak, likely hosting a Compton-thick AGN. Our recent Chandra observation\nof NGC 7590 enables to remove the X-ray contamination from the ULX and the\nextended component effectively. The nuclear source remains undetected at\n~4x10^{-15} erg\/s\/cm^-2 flux level. Although not detected, Chandra data gives a\n2--10 keV flux upper limit of ~6.1x10^{-15} erg\/s\/cm^-2 (at 3 sigma level), a\nfactor of 3 less than the XMM value, strongly supporting the Compton-thick\nnature of the nucleus. In addition, we detected five off-nuclear X-ray point\nsources within the galaxy D25 ellipse, all with 2 -- 10 keV luminosity above\n2x10^{38} erg\/s (assuming the distance of NGC 7590).

Masers at 36, 84, 44 and 95 GHz are most\nwidespread, while 9.9, 25, 23.4 and 104 GHz masers are much rarer, tracing the\nmost energetic shocks. A survey of many southern masers at 36 and 44 GHz\nsuggests that these two transitions are highly complementary. The 23.4 GHz\nmaser is a new type of rare class I methanol maser, detected only in two\nhigh-mass star-forming regions, G357.97-0.16 and G343.12-0.06, and showing a\nbehaviour similar to 9.9, 25 and 104 GHz masers. Interferometric positions\nsuggest that shocks responsible for class I masers could arise from a range of\nphenomena, not merely an outflow scenario. For example, some masers might be\ncaused by interaction of an expanding HII region with its surrounding molecular\ncloud. This has implications for evolutionary sequences incorporating class I\nmethanol masers if they appear more than once during the evolution of the\nstar-forming region.

Within this work we investigate the\nrelation between current sheets and vortex sheets in incompressible, stationary\nequilibria. For this approach it is helpful that the similar mathematical\nstructure of magnetohydrostatics and stationary incompressible hydrodynamics\nallows us to transform static equilibria into stationary ones. The main control\nfunction for such a transformation is the profile of the Alfven-Mach number\nM_A, which is always constant along magnetic field lines, but can change from\none field line to another. In the case of a global constant M_A, vortices and\nelectric current concentrations are parallel. More interesting is the nonlinear\ncase, where M_A varies perpendicular to the field lines. This is a typical\nsituation at boundary layers like the magnetopause, heliopause, the solar wind\nflowing around helmet streamers and at the boundary of solar coronal holes. The\ncorresponding current and vortex sheets show in some cases also an alignment,\nbut not in every case. For special density distributions in 2D it is possible\nto have current but no vortex sheets. In 2D vortex sheets of field\naligned-flows can also exist without strong current sheets, taking the limit of\nsmall Alfven Mach numbers into account. The current sheet can vanish if the\nAlfven Mach number is (almost) constant and the density gradient is large\nacross some boundary layer. It should be emphasized that the used theory is not\nonly valid for small Alfven Mach numbers M_A<<1, but also for M_A~1. Connection\nto other theoretical approaches and observations and physical effects in space\nplasmas are presented. Differences in the various aspects of theoretical\ninvestigations of current sheets and vortex sheets are given.\n","330853":"  Stable massive neutral particles emitted by astrophysical sources undergo\ndeflection under the gravitational potential of our own galaxy. The deflection\nangle depends on the particle velocity and therefore non-relativistic particles\nwill be deflected more than relativistic ones. If these particles can be\ndetected through neutrino telescopes, cosmic ray detectors or directional dark\nmatter detectors, their arrival directions would appear aligned on the sky\nalong the source-lens direction. On top of this deflection, the arrival\ndirection of non-relativistic particles is displaced with respect to the\nrelativistic counterpart also due to the relative motion of the source with\nrespect to the observer; this induces an alignment of detections along the sky\nprojection of the source trajectory. The final alignment will be given by a\ncombination of the directions induced by lensing and source proper motion. We\nderive the deflection-velocity relation for the Milky Way halo and suggest that\nsearching for alignments on detection maps of particle telescopes could be a\nway to find new particles or new astrophysical phenomena.\n","330854":"  In this paper, we introduce the notion of log-{\\varphi}-convex functions and\npresent some properties and representation of such functions.

Finaly, a version of Hermite\nHadamard-type inequalities for strongly {\\varphi}-convex functions are\nestablished.\n","330857":"  An interesting result by T. Kato and A. Pazy says that a contractive\nsemigroup (T(t)) on a uniformly convex space X is holomorphic iff limsup_{t\n\\downarrow 0} ||T(t)-Id|| < 2. We study extensions of this result which are\nvalid on arbitrary Banach spaces for semigroups which are not necessarily\ncontractive. This allows us to prove a general extrapolation result for\nholomorphy of semigroups on interpolation spaces of exponent {\\theta} in (0,1).\nAs application we characterize boundedness of the generator of a cosine family\non a UMD-space by a zero-two law. Moreover, our methods can be applied to\nR-sectoriality: We obtain a characterization of maximal regularity by the\nbehaviour of the semigroup at zero and show extrapolation results.\n","330858":"  We present an extension of the Courant bracket to the ones for Dp-branes by\nanalyzing Hamiltonians and local superalgebras. Contrast to the basis of the\nbracket for a fundamental string which consists of the momentum and the winding\nmodes, the ones for Dp-branes contain higher rank R-R coupling tensors. We show\nthat the R-R gauge transformation rules are obtained by these Courant brackets\nfor Dp-branes where the Dirac-Born-Infeld gauge field and the \"two-vierbein\nfield\" play an essential role. Canonical analysis of the worldvolume theories\nnaturally gives the basis of the brackets and the target space backgrounds\nkeeping T-duality manifest at least for NS-NS sector. In a D3-brane analysis\nS-duality is manifest as a symmetry of interchanging the NS-NS coupling and the\nR-R coupling.\n","330859":"  A stellar wind passing through the reverse shock is deflected into the\nastrospheric tail and leaves the stellar system either as a sub-Alfvenic or as\na super-Alfvenic tail flow. An example is our own heliosphere and its\nheliotail. We present an analytical method of calculating stationary,\nincompressible, and field-aligned plasma flows in the astrotail of a star. We\npresent a recipe for constructing an astrosphere with the help of only a few\nparameters, like the inner Alfven Mach number and the outer Alfven Mach number,\nthe magnetic field strength within and outside the stellar wind cavity, and the\ndistribution of singular points of the magnetic field within these flows.\nWithin the framework of a one-fluid approximation, it is possible to obtain\nsolutions of the MHD equations for stationary flows from corresponding static\nMHD equilibria, by using noncanonical mappings of the canonical variables. The\ncanonical variables are the Euler potentials of the magnetic field of\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibria. Thus we start from static equilibria determined\nby the distribution of magnetic neutral points, and assume that the Alfven Mach\nnumber for the corresponding stationary equilibria is finite. The topological\nstructure determines the geometrical structure of the interstellar gas -\nstellar wind interface. Additional boundary conditions like the outer magnetic\nfield and the jump of the magnetic field across the astropause allow\ndetermination of the noncanonical transformations. This delivers the strength\nof the magnetic field at every point in the astrotail region beyond the reverse\nshock. The mathematical technique for describing such a scenario is applied to\nastrospheres in general, but is also relevant for the heliosphere. It shows the\nrestrictions of the outer and the inner magnetic field strength in comparison\nwith the corresponding Alfven Mach numbers in the case of subalfvenic flows.\n","330860":"  The paper is devoted to the variational analysis of the Willmore, and other\nL^2 curvature functionals, among immersions of 2-dimensional surfaces into a\ncompact riemannian m-manifold (M^m,h) with m>2. The goal of the paper is\ntwofold, on one hand, we give the right setting for doing the calculus of\nvariations (including min max methods) of such functionals for immersions into\nmanifolds and, on the other hand, we prove existence results for possibly\nbranched Willmore spheres under various constraints (prescribed homotopy class,\nprescribed area) or under curvature assumptions for M^m. To this aim, using the\nintegrability by compensation, we develop first the regularity theory for the\ncritical points of such functionals. We then prove a rigidity theorem\nconcerning the relation between CMC and Willmore spheres. Then we prove that,\nfor every non null 2-homotopy class, there exists a representative given by a\nLipschitz map from the 2-sphere into M^m realizing a connected family of\nconformal smooth (possibly branched) area constrained Willmore spheres (as\nexplained in the introduction, this comes as a natural extension of the minimal\nimmersed spheres in homotopy class constructed by Sacks and Uhlembeck in\n\\cite{SaU}, in situations when they do not exist). Moreover, for every A>0 we\nminimize the Willmore functional among connected families of weak, possibly\nbranched, immersions of the 2-sphere having prescribed total area equal to A\nand we prove full regularity for the minimizer. Finally, under a mild curvature\ncondition on (M^m,h), we minimize the sum of the area with the square of the\nL^2 norm of the second fundamental form, among weak possibly branched\nimmersions of the two sphere and we prove the regularity of the minimizer.\n","330861":"  This paper aims to shed some light on the concept of virality - especially in\nsocial networks - and to provide new insights on its structure. We argue that:\n(a) virality is a phenomenon strictly connected to the nature of the content\nbeing spread, rather than to the influencers who spread it, (b) virality is a\nphenomenon with many facets, i.e. under this generic term several different\neffects of persuasive communication are comprised and they only partially\noverlap. To give ground to our claims, we provide initial experiments in a\nmachine learning framework to show how various aspects of virality can be\nindependently predicted according to content features.\n","330862":"  We analyze the influence of finite ion size effects in the response of a\nsalt-free concentrated suspension of spherical particles to an oscillating\nelectric field. Salt-free suspensions are just composed of charged colloidal\nparticles and the added counterions released by the particles to the solution,\nthat counterbalance their surface charge. In the frequency domain, we study the\ndynamic electrophoretic mobility of the particles and the dielectric response\nof the suspension. We find that the Maxwell-Wagner-O'Konski process associated\nwith the counterions condensation layer, is enhanced for moderate to high\nparticle charges, yielding an increment of the mobility for such frequencies.\nWe also find that the increment of the mobility grows with ion size and\nparticle charge. All these facts show the importance of including ion size\neffects in any extension attempting to improve standard electrokinetic models.\n","330863":"  We compare tunneling density of states (TDOS) into two ultrathin Ag films,\none uniform and one granular, for different degrees of disorder. The uniform\nfilm shows a crossover from Altshuler-Aronov (AA) zero bias anomaly to Efros\nShklovskii (ES) like Coulomb gap as the disorder is increased. The granular\nfilm, on the other hand, exhibits AA behavior even deeply in the insulating\nregime. We analyze the data and find that granularity introduces a new regime\nfor the TDOS. While the conductivity is dominated by hopping between clusters\nof grains and is thus insulating, the TDOS probes the properties of an\nindividual cluster which is \"metallic\".\n","330864":"  We investigate the triangle singularity $f=x^a+y^b+z^c$, or $S=k[x,y,z]\/(f)$,\nattached to a weighted projective line $X$ given by the weight triple\n$(a,b,c)$. We investigate the stable category of vector bundles on $X$ obtained\nfrom the vector bundles by factoring out all line bundles. This category is\ntriangulated and has Serre duality. It is, moreover, naturally equivalent to\nthe stable category of graded maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over $S$ (or\nmatrix factorizations of $f$), and then by results of Buchweitz and Orlov to\nthe graded singularity category of $f$. We show that this category is\nfractional Calabi-Yau with a CY-dimension that is a function of the Euler\ncharacteristic of $X$. We show the existence of a tilting object which has the\nshape of an $(a-1)(b-1)(c-1)$-cuboid. Particular attention is given to the\nweight types $(2,a,b)$, yielding an explanation of Happel-Seidel symmetry for a\nclass of important Nakayama algebras. In particular, the weight sequence\n$(2,3,p)$ corresponds to an ADE-chain, the $E_n$-chain, extrapolating the\nexceptional Dynkin cases $E_6$, $E_7$ and $E_8$ to a whole sequence of\ntriangulated categories.\n","330865":"  The IR emission spectra of molecules are deduced from the time variations of\ntheir overall electric dipole moment.\n","330866":"  An overview is given of recent advances in the nonequilibrium statistical\nmechanics of quantum systems and, especially, of time-reversal symmetry\nrelations that have been discovered in this context. The systems considered are\ndriven out of equilibrium by time-dependent forces or by coupling to large\nreservoirs of particles and energy. The symmetry relations are established for\nthe exchange of energy and particles between the subsystem and its environment.\nThese results have important consequences. In particular, generalizations of\nthe Kubo formula and the Casimir-Onsager reciprocity relations can be deduced\nbeyond linear response properties. Applications to electron quantum transport\nin mesoscopic semiconducting circuits are discussed.\n","330867":"  Based on the algebraic cobordism theory of Levine and Morel, we develop a\ntheory of algebraic cobordism modulo algebraic equivalence.\n  We prove that this theory can reproduce Chow groups modulo algebraic\nequivalence and the semi-topological $K_0$-groups. We also show that with\nfinite coefficients, this theory agrees with the algebraic cobordism theory.\n  We compute our cobordism theory for some low dimensional varieties. The\nresults on infinite generation of some Griffiths groups by Clemens and on\nsmash-nilpotence by Voevodsky and Voisin are also lifted and reinterpreted in\nterms of this cobordism theory.\n","330868":"  Two new carbon allotropes (H-carbon and S-carbon) are proposed, as possible\ncandidates for the intermediate superhard phases between graphite and diamond\nobtained in the process of cold compressing graphite, based on the results of\nfirst-principles calculations. Both H-carbon and S-carbon are more stable than\npreviously proposed M-carbon and W-carbon and their bulk modulus are comparable\nto that of diamond. H-carbon is an indirect-band-gap semiconductor with a gap\nof 4.459 eV and S-carbon is a direct-band-gap semiconductor with a gap of 4.343\neV. The transition pressure from cold compressing graphite is 10.08 GPa and\n5.93 Gpa for H-carbon and S-carbon, respectively, which is in consistent with\nthe recent experimental report.\n","330869":"  We characterize the Maass cusp forms for Hecke congruence subgroups of prime\nlevel as 1-eigenfunctions of a finite-term transfer operator.\n","330870":"  The effects of a radiation field (RF) on the unstable modes developed in\nrelativistic electron beam--plasma interaction are investigated assuming that\n$\\omega_{0} >\\omega_{p}$, where $\\omega_{0}$ is the frequency of the RF and\n$\\omega_{p}$ is the plasma frequency. These unstable modes are parametrically\ncoupled to each other due to the RF and are a mix between two--stream and\nparametric instabilities. The dispersion equations are derived by the\nlinearization of the kinetic equations for a beam--plasma system as well as the\nMaxwell equations. In order to highlight the effect of the radiation field we\npresent a comparison of our analytical and numerical results obtained for\nnonzero RF with those for vanishing RF. Assuming that the drift velocity\n$\\mathbf{u}_{b}$ of the beam is parallel to the wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$ of the\nexcitations two particular transversal and parallel configurations of the\npolarization vector $\\mathbf{E}_{0}$ of the RF with respect to $\\mathbf{k}$ are\nconsidered in detail. It is shown that in both geometries resonant and\nnonresonant couplings between different modes are possible. The largest growth\nrates are expected at the transversal configuration when $\\mathbf{E}_{0}$ is\nperpendicular to $\\mathbf{k}$. In this case it is demonstrated that in general\nthe spectrum of the unstable modes in $\\omega $--$k$ plane is split into two\ndistinct domains with long and short wavelengths, where the unstable modes are\nmainly sensitive to the beam or the RF parameters, respectively. In parallel\nconfiguration, $\\mathbf{E}_{0} \\parallel \\mathbf{k}$, and at short wavelengths\nthe growth rates of the unstable modes are sensitive to both beam and RF\nparameters remaining insensitive to the RF at long wavelengths.\n","330871":"  On a Riemannian surface, the energy of a map into a Riemannian manifold is a\nconformal invariant functional, and its critical points are the harmonic maps.\nOur main result is a generalization of this theorem when the starting manifold\nis even dimensional. We then build a conformal invariant functional for the\nmaps between two Riemannian manifolds. Its critical points then called\nC--harmonic are the solutions of a nonlinear elliptic PDE of order $n$, which\nis conformal covariant with respect to the start manifold. For the trivial case\nof real or complex functions of $M$, we find again the GJMS operator, with a\nleading part power to the $n\/2$ of the Laplacian.

Only strong magnetic fields (B>100 G) of the equatorial region\nwere taken into account. The north-south asymmetry of the magnetic fluxes was\nconsidered as well as the imbalance between positive and negative fluxes. The\nnorth-south asymmetry displays a regular alternation of the dominant hemisphere\nduring the solar cycle: the northern hemisphere dominated in the ascending\nphase, the southern one in the descending phase during Solar Cycles 21-23. The\nsign of the imbalance did not change during the 11 years from one polar-field\nreversal to the next and always coincided with the sign of the Sun's polar\nmagnetic field in the northern hemisphere. The dominant sign of leading\nsunspots in one of the hemispheres determines the sign of the magnetic-flux\nimbalance. The sign of the north-south asymmetry of the magnetic fluxes and the\nsign of the imbalance of the positive and the negative fluxes are related to\nthe quarter of the 22-year magnetic cycle where the magnetic configuration of\nthe Sun remains constant (from the minimum where the sunspot sign changes\naccording to Hale's law to the magnetic-field reversal and from the reversal to\nthe minimum). The sign of the north-south asymmetry for the time interval\nconsidered was determined by the phase of the 11-year cycle (before or after\nthe reversal); the sign of the imbalance of the positive and the negative\nfluxes depends on both the phase of the 11-year cycle and on the parity of the\nsolar cycle. The results obtained demonstrate the connection of the magnetic\nfields in active regions with the Sun's polar magnetic field in the northern\nhemisphere.\n","330874":"  Weakly collisional Ar-O2 electronegative plasmas are investigated in a dc\nmultidipole chamber.

Furthermore, we establish a\ncriterion for the \"good\", the \"bad\", and the \"ugly\" trichotomy of the theories.\nAfter interpreting the prescription to compute the index with non-maximal\nflavor symmetry as a residue calculus we address the computation of the index\nof the bad theories.

Such a system can be considered\nas an approximation of the natural material azurite, Cu3(CO3)2(OH)2. For values\nof exchange parameters, which are taken from experimental results, we study the\nthermodynamic properties, such as azurite specific heat and magnetic\nsusceptibility.

We christen the latter symmetry\ntransformations as the dual-gauge transformations. We generalize the above\ngauge and dual-gauge transformations to obtain the proper (anti-)BRST and\n(anti-)dual-BRST transformations for the Abelian 3-form gauge theory within the\nframework of BRST formalism. We concisely mention such symmetries for the 2D\nfree Abelian 1-form and 4D free Abelian 2-form gauge theories and briefly\ndiscuss their topological aspects in our present endeavor. We conjecture that\nany arbitrary Abelian p-form gauge theory would respect the above cited\nadditional symmetry in D = 2p (p = 1, 2, 3,...) dimensions of spacetime. By\nexploiting the above inputs, we establish that the Abelian 3-form gauge theory,\nin six (5 + 1)-dimensions of spacetime, is a perfect model for the Hodge theory\nwhose discrete and continuous symmetry transformations provide the physical\nrealizations of all aspects of the de Rham cohomological operators of\ndifferential geometry. As far as the physical utility of the above nilpotent\nsymmetries is concerned, we demonstrate that the 2D Abelian 1-form gauge theory\nis a perfect model of a new class of topological theory and 4D Abelian 2-form\nas well as 6D Abelian 3-form gauge theories are the field theoretic models for\nthe quasi-topological field theory.\n","330879":"  Let $X,X_1,...,X_n$ be independent identically distributed random variables.\nThe paper deals with the question about the behavior of the concentration\nfunction of the random variable $\\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_k X_k$ according to the\narithmetic structure of coefficients $a_k$. Recently the interest to this\nquestion has increased significantly due to the study of distributions of\neigenvalues of random matrices.

We apply belief propagation and the related cavity method to the\nreweighted partition function. This allows us to obtain several new results on\nthe properties of random K-satisfiability problem. In particular the\nreweighting allows to introduce a planted ensemble that generates instances\nthat are, in some region of parameters, equivalent to random instances. We are\nhence able to generate at the same time a typical random SAT instance and one\nof its solutions. We study the relation between clustering and belief\npropagation fixed points and we give a direct evidence for the existence of\npurely entropic (rather than energetic) barriers between clusters in some\nregion of parameters in the random K-satisfiability problem. We exhibit, in\nsome large planted instances, solutions with a non-trivial whitening core; such\nsolutions were known to exist but were so far never found on very large\ninstances.

The resulting topological model has also a mathematical interest\nin itself. The present paper is then the application to the Bose-Einstein\nCondensation phenomena, of the harmonic analysis aspects arising from additive\nand density zero perturbations, previously investigated by the author in a\nseparate work. Concerning the appearance of the Bose-Einstein Condensation, the\nresults are surprisingly in accordance with the previous ones, despite the lack\nof amenability. We indeed first show the following fact. Even when the critical\ndensity is finite (which is implied in all the models under consideration,\nthanks to the appearance of the hidden spectrum), if the adjacency operator of\nthe graph is recurrent, it is impossible to exhibit temperature locally normal\nstates (i.e. states for which the local particle density is finite) describing\nthe condensation at all. The same occurs in the transient cases for which it is\nimpossible to exhibit locally normal states describing the Bose--Einstein\nCondensation at mean particle density strictly greater than the critical\ndensity . In addition, for the transient cases, in order to construct locally\nnormal temperature states through infinite volume limits of finite volume Gibbs\nstates, a careful choice of the the sequence of the finite volume chemical\npotential should be done. For all such states, the condensate is essentially\nallocated on the base--point supporting the perturbation. This leads that the\nparticle density always coincide with the critical one. It is shown that all\nsuch temperature states are Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states for a natural\ndynamics. The construction of such a dynamics, which is a very delicate issue,\nis also done.\n","330882":"  In this paper, we propose a system for wireless video transmission with a\nwireless physical layer (PHY) that supports cooperative forwarding of\ninterfered\/superimposed packets.

For this new PHY the\naverage transmission rate that each node can achieve is estimated first. Next,\nwe formulate a utility optimization framework for the video transmission\nproblem and we show that it can be simplified due to the features of the new\nPHY.

This specific Markov transition system allows to define a general\n\\emph{set-indexed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (SIOU) process} with any initial\nprobability measure.

A consistent regularization, which does not break the\nsupersymmetry, is the higher covariant derivative regularization. However, the\nintegrals obtained with this regularization can not be usually calculated\nanalytically. We discuss application of this regularization to the calculations\nin supersymmetric theories. In particular, it is demonstrated that integrals\ndefining the beta-function are possibly integrals of total derivatives. This\nfeature allows to explain the origin of the exact NSVZ beta-function, relating\nthe beta-function with the anomalous dimensions of the matter superfields.\nHowever, integrals for the anomalous dimension should be calculated\nnumerically.\n","330885":"  The solid solution 0.5Ba(Ti0.8Zr0.2)O3-0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BCZT) is a\npromising lead-free piezoelectric material with exceptionally high\npiezoelectric coefficients.

We show that graphene possesses a giant nonlinear refractive\nindex n2=10-7cm2W-1, almost nine orders of magnitude larger than bulk\ndielectrics. We find that the nonlinear refractive index decreases with\nincreasing excitation flux but slower than the absorption.

The Coriolis force induced by\norbital motion deflects the shocked flows, strongly affecting their dynamics.\nWe study the evolution of the shocked stellar and pulsar winds on scales in\nwhich the orbital motion is important. Potential sites of non-thermal activity\nare investigated. Relativistic hydrodynamical simulations in two dimensions,\nperformed with the code PLUTO and using the adaptive mesh refinement technique,\nare used to model interacting stellar and pulsar winds on scales ~80 times the\ndistance between the stars. The hydrodynamical results suggest the suitable\nlocations of sites for particle acceleration and non-thermal emission. In\naddition to the shock formed towards the star, the shocked and unshocked\ncomponents of the pulsar wind flowing away from the star terminate by means of\nadditional strong shocks produced by the orbital motion. Strong instabilities\nlead to the development of turbulence and an effective two-wind mixing in both\nthe leading and trailing sides of the interaction structure, which starts to\nmerge with itself after one orbit. The adopted moderate pulsar-wind Lorentz\nfactor already provides a good qualitative description of the phenomena\ninvolved in high-mass binaries with pulsars, and can capture important physical\neffects that would not appear in non-relativistic treatments. Simulations show\nthat shocks, instabilities, and mass-loading yield efficient mass, momentum,\nand energy exchanges between the pulsar and the stellar winds. This renders a\nrapid increase in the entropy of the shocked structure, which will likely be\ndisrupted on scales beyond the simulated ones. Several sites of particle\nacceleration and low- and high-energy emission can be identified.

Five of these are spectroscopically\nconfirmed to be heavily reddened Type 1 AGN with broad emission lines bringing\nour total sample of reddened quasars from the UKIDSS-LAS to 12 at z=1.4-2.7. At\nthese redshifts, Ha (6563A) is in the K-band. However, the mean Ha equivalent\nwidth of the reddened quasars is only ten per cent larger than that of the\noptically selected population and cannot explain the extreme colours. Instead,\ndust extinction of Av~2-6 mags is required to reproduce the continuum colours\nof our sources. This is comparable to the dust extinctions seen in\nsubmillimetre galaxies at similar redshifts. We argue that the AGN are likely\nbeing observed in a relatively short-lived breakout phase when they are\nexpelling gas and dust following a massive starburst, subsequently turning into\nUV-luminous quasars. Some of our quasars show direct evidence for strong\noutflows (v~800-1000 km\/s) affecting the Ha line consistent with this scenario.\nWe predict that a larger fraction of reddened quasar hosts are likely to be\nsubmillimetre bright compared to the UV-luminous quasar population. We use our\nsample to place new constraints on the fraction of obscured Type 1 AGN likely\nto be missed in optical surveys. Taken at face-value our findings suggest that\nthe obscured fraction depends on quasar luminosity. The space density of\nobscured quasars is ~5x that inferred for UV-bright quasars from the SDSS\nluminosity function at Mi<-30 but seems to drop at lower luminosities even\naccounting for various sources of incompleteness in our sample (abridged).\n","330890":"  We extend the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) framework to a linear second-order\nelliptic problem on a compact smooth connected and oriented surface.

We provide\nperformance bounds for non-stationary policies involving the last $m$ generated\npolicies that reduce the state-of-the-art bound for the last stationary policy\n$\\pi_k$ by a factor $\\frac{1-\\gamma}{1-\\gamma^m}$.

Given Bellman operators that can only be computed\nwith some error $\\epsilon$, a surprising consequence of this result is that the\nproblem of \"computing an approximately optimal non-stationary policy\" is much\nsimpler than that of \"computing an approximately optimal stationary policy\",\nand even slightly simpler than that of \"approximately computing the value of\nsome fixed policy\", since this last problem only has a guarantee of\n$\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}\\epsilon$.\n","330892":"  Consider the following forest-fire process on a connected graph.

If the qubit-resonator coupling strength g is much smaller than\nthe qubit energy splitting, the system initially excited into the\nnear-degenerate single-excitation subspace stays within that subspace, while\nsmoothly evolving toward the fully uniform W state superposition. The duration\nof the final entangling operation is found to decrease with the total number of\nthe qubits according to t = pi\/[2gN^(1\/2)], in agreement with some of the\npreviously proposed cavity QED W state generation schemes.\n","330894":"  Unlike Martin-L\\\"of randomness and Schnorr randomness, computable randomness\nhas not been defined, except for a few ad hoc cases, outside of Cantor space.\nThis paper offers such a definition (actually, several equivalent definitions),\nand further, provides a general method for abstracting \"bit-wise\" definitions\nof randomness from Cantor space to arbitrary computable probability spaces.\nThis same method is also applied to give machine characterizations of\ncomputable and Schnorr randomness for computable probability spaces, extending\nthe previously known results.

With several\nillustrating applications, we discuss the implications of RPA for computational\nchemistry and materials science. The computational cost of RPA is also\naddressed which is critical for its widespread use in future applications. In\naddition, current correction schemes going beyond RPA and directions of further\ndevelopment will be discussed.\n","330896":"  Exoplanet orbital eccentricities offer valuable clues about the history of\nplanetary systems. Eccentric, Jupiter-sized planets are particularly\ninteresting: they may link the \"cold\" Jupiters beyond the ice line to close-in\nhot Jupiters, which are unlikely to have formed in situ. To date,\neccentricities of individual transiting planets primarily come from radial\nvelocity measurements. Kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting Jupiters\nspanning a range of periods, but the faintness of the host stars precludes\nradial velocity follow-up of most. Here we demonstrate a Bayesian method of\nmeasuring an individual planet's eccentricity solely from its transit light\ncurve using prior knowledge of its host star's density. We show that eccentric\nJupiters are readily identified by their short ingress\/egress\/total transit\ndurations -- part of the \"photoeccentric\" light curve signature of a planet's\neccentricity --- even with long-cadence Kepler photometry and\nloosely-constrained stellar parameters. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration\nof parameter posteriors naturally marginalizes over the periapse angle and\nautomatically accounts for the transit probability. To demonstrate, we use\nthree published transit light curves of HD 17156 b to measure an eccentricity\nof e = 0.71 +0.16\/-0.09, in good agreement with the discovery value e =\n0.67+\/-0.08 based on 33 radial-velocity measurements. We present two additional\ntests using actual Kepler data. In each case the technique proves to be a\nviable method of measuring exoplanet eccentricities and their confidence\nintervals. Finally, we argue that this method is the most efficient, effective\nmeans of identifying the extremely eccentric, proto hot Jupiters predicted by\nSocrates et al.

Follow-up X-ray\nobservations of a dynamically relaxed sub-sample of newly discovered Planck\nclusters will improve constraints on the dark energy equation-of-state found\nthrough measurement of the cluster gas mass fraction fgas. In view of follow-up\ncampaigns with XMM-Newton and Chandra, we determine the optimal redshift\ndistribution of a cluster sample to most tightly constrain the dark energy\nequation of state. The distribution is non-trivial even for the standard w0-wa\nparameterization. We then determine how much the combination of expected data\nfrom the Planck satellite and fgas data will be able to constrain the dark\nenergy equation-of-state. Our analysis employs a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nmethod as well as a Fisher Matrix analysis.

Gluinos should be lighter than several TeV so\nas not to destabilize the lighter squarks. First and second generation\nsfermions can be at the tens-of-TeV level which yields a decoupling solution to\nthe SUSY flavor and CP problems. Adopting a top-down approach, we delineate the\nrange of GUT scale SUSY model parameters which leads to a Natural SUSY mass\nspectrum. We find natural SUSY models to be tightly constrained by the b->\ns\\gamma branching fraction measurement while it is also difficult but not\nimpossible to accommodate a light Higgs scalar of mass ~125 GeV. We present\nseveral benchmark points which are expandable to slopes and planes. Natural\nSUSY is difficult to see at LHC unless some third generation squarks are very\nlight. The top- and bottom- squarks cascade decay mainly to higgsino-like\ncharginos and neutralinos via numerous possibilities, leading to a rather\ncomplex set of signatures. Meanwhile, a linear e^+e^- collider operating at\n\\sqrt{s}\\sim 0.25-0.5 TeV would be a higgsino factory and is essentially\nguaranteed a SUSY discovery of the low-lying charged and neutral higgsino\nstates. Since thermal neutralino cold dark matter is underproduced, we\nconjecture that the incorporation of a Peccei-Quinn sector or light moduli into\nthe theory will augment higgsino dark matter production, possibly together with\nan admixture of axions. We present rates for direct and indirect higgsino dark\nmatter detection for the case where light higgsinos dominate the dark matter\nabundance.\n","330899":"  The quantum-Hall-effect (QHE) occurs in topologically-ordered states of\ntwo-dimensional (2d) electron-systems in which an insulating bulk-state\ncoexists with protected 1d conducting edge-states. Owing to a unique\ntopologically imposed edge-bulk correspondence these edge-states are endowed\nwith universal properties such as fractionally-charged quasiparticles and\ninterference-patterns, which make them indispensable components for QH-based\nquantum-computation and other applications. The precise edge-bulk\ncorrespondence, conjectured theoretically in the limit of sharp edges, is\ndifficult to realize in conventional semiconductor-based electron systems where\nsoft boundaries lead to edge-state reconstruction. Using scanning-tunneling\nmicroscopy and spectroscopy to follow the spatial evolution of bulk\nLandau-levels towards a zigzag edge of graphene supported above a graphite\nsubstrate we demonstrate that in this system it is possible to realize\natomically sharp edges with no edge-state reconstruction. Our results single\nout graphene as a system where the edge-state structure can be controlled and\nthe universal properties directly probed.\n","330900":"  We show that a topological superconductor made of four chains of\nsuperconducting spinless fermions characterized by four Majorana edge states\ncan adiabatically be deformed into a trivial band insulator. To unwind this\ntime-reversal invariant topological superconductor, interactions to spinful\nfermions are switched on along an adiabatic path. Thereby, we couple modes\nwhich belong to two different representations of the time-reversal symmetry\noperator T with T^2 = 1 and T^2 = -1, respectively. This observation can be\nunderstood by investigating how the relevant symmetries act on the entanglement\nspectrum giving rise to four instead of eight different topological phases with\nMajorana edge modes. We also show that a simple level crossing of doubly and\nsingly degenerate states occurs in the entanglement spectrum upon deforming the\nquantum state.\n","330901":"  We report on interferometric observations at 1.3 mm at 2\"-3\" resolution using\nthe Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA). We\nidentify multi-wavelength counterparts of three submillimeter galaxies (SMGs;\nF(1mm)>5.5 mJy) in the COSMOS field, initially detected with MAMBO and AzTEC\nbolometers at low, ~10\"-30\", resolution. All three sources -- AzTEC\/C1, Cosbo-3\nand Cosbo-8 -- are identified to coincide with positions of 20 cm radio\nsources. Cosbo-3, however, is not associated with the most likely radio\ncounterpart, closest to the MAMBO source position, but that further away from\nit. This illustrates the need for intermediate-resolution (~2\") mm-observations\nto identify the correct counterparts of single-dish detected SMGs. All of our\nthree sources become prominent only at NIR wavelengths, and their mm-to-radio\nflux based redshifts suggest that they lie at redshifts z>~2. As a proof of\nconcept, we show that photometric redshifts can be well determined for SMGs,\nand we find photometric-redshifts of 5.6+\/-1.2, 1.9+0.9(-0.5), and ~4 for\nAzTEC\/C1, Cosbo-3, and Cosbo-8, respectively. Using these we infer that these\ngalaxies have radio-based star formation rates of >~1000 Msol\/yr, and IR\nluminosities of ~10^13 Lsol consistent with properties of high-redshift SMGs.\nIn summary, our sources reflect a variety of SMG properties in terms of\nredshift and clustering, consistent with the framework that SMGs are\nprogenitors of z~2 and today's passive galaxies.\n","330902":"  We report parallax measurements for 70 ultracool dwarfs (UCDs). Using both\nliterature values and our sample, we report new polynomial relations between\nspectral type and M$_{JHK}$. Including resolved L\/T transition binaries in the\nrelations, we find no reason to differentiate between a \"bright\" (unresolved\nbinary) and \"faint\" (single source) sample across the L\/T boundary. Isolating\nearly T dwarfs, we find that the brightening of T0-T4 sources is prominent in\nM$_{J}$ where there is a [1.2 - 1.4] magnitude difference. A similar yet\ndampened brightening of [0.3 - 0.5] magnitude happens at M$_{H}$ and a plateau\nor dimming of [-0.2 - -0.3] magnitude is seen in M$_{K}$. Comparing with\nevolutionary models that vary gravity, metallicity, and cloud thickness we find\nthat a near constant temperature of 1200 $\\pm$100 K along a narrow spectral\nsubtype of T0-T4 is required to account for the brightening and color magnitude\ndiagram of the L-dwarf\/T-dwarf transition. Furthermore, there is a significant\npopulation of both L and T dwarfs which are red or potentially \"ultra-cloudy\"\ncompared to the models, many of which are known to be young indicating a\ncorrelation between enhanced photospheric dust and youth. For the low\nsurface-gravity or young companion L dwarfs we find that 8 out of 10 are at\nleast [0.2-1.0] magnitude underluminous in M$_{JH}$ and\/or M$_{K}$ compared to\nequivalent spectral type objects. We speculate that this is a consequence of\nincreased dust opacity and conclude that low-surface gravity L dwarfs require a\ncompletely new spectral-type\/absolute magnitude polynomial for analysis.\n","330903":"  We show that grand unified theories based on SO(10) generate naturally the\nnext-to-leading baryon number violating operators of dimension seven. These\noperators, which violate B-L, lead to unconventional decays of the nucleon such\nas n -> e^-K^+, e^- \\pi^+ and p -> \\nu \\pi^+. In two-step breaking schemes of\nnon-supersymmetric SO(10), nucleon lifetime for decays into these modes is\nfound to be within reach of experiments. We also identify supersymmetric\nscenarios where these decays may be accessible, consistent with gauge coupling\nunification. Further, we show that the (B-L)-asymmetry generated in the decays\nof GUT scale scalar bosons and\/or gauge bosons can explain consistently the\nobserved baryon asymmetry of the universe. The induced (B-L)-asymmetry is\nsphaleron-proof, and survives down to the weak scale without being erased by\nthe electroweak interactions. This mechanism works efficiently in a large class\nof non-SUSY and SUSY SO(10) models, with either a 126 or a 16 Higgs field\nemployed for rank reduction. In minimal models the induced baryon asymmetry is\ntightly connected to the masses of quarks, leptons and neutrinos and is found\nto be compatible with observations.\n","330904":"  This paper continues the study of highest weight categorical sl_2-actions\nstarted in part I. We start by refining the definition given there and showing\nthat all examples considered in part I are also highest weight\ncategorifications in the refined sense. Then we prove that any highest weight\nsl_2-categorification can be filtered in such a way that the successive\nquotients are so called basic highest weight sl_2-categorifications. For a\nbasic highest weight categorification we determine minimal projective\nresolutions of standard objects. We use this, in particular, to examine the\nstructure of tilting objects in basic categorifications and to show that the\nRingel duality is given by the Rickard complex.

The proof of\nthe theorem does not provide an explicit procedure for recovering $V$ from\n$A(V)$, and finding such a procedure is a long-standing open problem. In this\npaper, we present an explicit way for reconstructing $V$ from $A(V)$ up to\nbiholomorphic equivalence under the assumption that the singularity of $V$ is\nhomogeneous, in which case $A(V)$ coincides with the Milnor algebra of $V$.\n","330909":"  The Euler-Gauss linear transformation formula for the hypergeometric function\nwas extended by Goursat for the case of logarithmic singularities.

In theory, the PNLF method should not work at\nall, since the luminosities of the brightest planetary nebulae (PNe) should be\nhighly sensitive to the age of their host stellar population. Yet the method\nappears robust, as it consistently produces < 10% distances to galaxies of all\nHubble types, from the earliest ellipticals to the latest-type spirals and\nirregulars. It is therefore uniquely suited for cross-checking the results of\nother techniques and finding small offsets between the Population I and\nPopulation II distance ladders. We review the calibration of the method and\nshow that the zero points provided by Cepheids and the Tip of the Red Giant\nBranch are in excellent agreement. We then compare the results of the PNLF with\nthose from Surface Brightness Fluctuation measurements, and show that, although\nboth techniques agree in a relative sense, the latter method yields distances\nthat are ~15% larger than those from the PNLF. We trace this discrepancy back\nto the calibration galaxies and argue that, due to a small systematic error\nassociated with internal reddening, the true distance scale likely falls\nbetween the extremes of the two methods. We also demonstrate how PNLF\nmeasurements in the early-type galaxies that have hosted Type Ia supernovae can\nhelp calibrate the SN Ia maximum magnitude-rate of decline relation. Finally,\nwe discuss how the results from space missions such as Kepler and Gaia can help\nour understanding of the PNLF phenomenon and improve our knowledge of the\nphysics of local planetary nebulae.\n","330911":"  We consider a theory of gravity with a hidden extra-dimension and\nmetric-dependent torsion.

At the kinematic level, the theory maps on to General Relativity, but\nthe dynamical field equations that follow from the action principle deviate\nmarkedly from the standard Einstein equations. We study static spherically\nsymmetric vacuum solutions and homogeneous-isotropic cosmological solutions\nthat emerge from the field equations. In both cases, we find solutions of\nsignificant physical interest. Most notably, we find positive mass solutions\nwith naked singularity that match the well known Schwarzschild solution at\nlarge distances but lack an event horizon. In the cosmological context, we find\noscillatory scenario in contrast to the inevitable, singular big bang of the\nstandard cosmology.\n","330912":"  In our continued efforts of matching full string computations with the\ncorresponding effective field theory computations, we evaluate string theory\ncorrelators in closed forms.

We show that the infinite number of massless poles of\nthis amplitude can be reproduced by the Born-Infeld action, the Wess-Zumino\nterms, and their higher derivative corrections. More specifically we find, up\nto an on-shell ambiguity, two scalar field and two gauge field couplings to all\norders in $\\alpha'$ such that the infinite number of massless poles of the\nfield theory amplitude exactly match the infinite number of massless poles of\nS-matrix elements of $<V_{C}V_{\\phi} V_AV_A>$.

This general phenomenon is illustrated by\nthe $AdS_4$ higher-spin gauge theory shown to be dual to the theory of 3d\nconformal currents of all spins interacting with 3d conformal higher-spin\nfields of Chern-Simons type. Generally, the resulting 3d boundary conformal\ntheory is nonlinear, providing an interacting version of the 3d boundary sigma\nmodel conjectured by Klebanov and Polyakov to be dual to the $AdS_4$ HS theory\nin the large $N$ limit. Being a gauge theory it escapes the conditions of the\ntheorem of Maldacena and Zhiboedov, which force a 3d boundary conformal theory\nto be free. Two reductions of particular higher-spin gauge theories where\nboundary higher-spin gauge fields decouple from the currents and which have\nfree boundary duals are identified. Higher-spin holographic duality is also\ndiscussed for the cases of $AdS_3\/CFT_2$ and duality between higher-spin\ntheories and nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. In the latter case it is shown\nin particular that ($dS$) $AdS$ geometry in the higher-spin setup is dual to\nthe (inverted) harmonic potential in the quantum-mechanical setup.\n","330914":"  In the second part of this study and similarly with part one, the nonlinear\nanalysis of the solar flares index is embedded in the non-extensive statistical\ntheory of Tsallis [1]. The triplet of Tsallis, as well as the correlation\ndimension and the Lyapunov exponent spectrum were estimated for the SVD\ncomponents of the solar flares timeseries. Also the multifractal scaling\nexponent spectrum, the generalized Renyi dimension spectrum and the spectrum of\nthe structure function exponents were estimated experimentally and\ntheoretically by using the entropy principle included in Tsallis non extensive\nstatistical theory, following Arimitsu and Arimitsu [2]. Our analysis showed\nclearly the following: a) a phase transition process in the solar flare\ndynamics from high dimensional non Gaussian SOC state to a low dimensional also\nnon Gaussian chaotic state, b) strong intermittent solar corona turbulence and\nanomalous (multifractal) diffusion solar corona process, which is strengthened\nas the solar corona dynamics makes phase transition to low dimensional chaos:\nc) faithful agreement of Tsallis non equilibrium statistical theory with the\nexperimental estimations of i) non-Gaussian probability distribution function,\nii) multifractal scaling exponent spectrum and generalized Renyi dimension\nspectrum, iii) exponent spectrum of the structure functions estimated for the\nsunspot index and its underlying non equilibrium solar dynamics. e) The solar\nflare dynamical profile is revealed similar to the dynamical profile of the\nsolar convection zone as far as the phase transition process from SOC to chaos\nstate.

The\nchemistry is solved as a function of time with three networks: one purely\ngas-phase, one that includes accretion and desorption, and one, the complete\ngas-grain network, that includes surface chemistry in addition. We compare our\nresults with observed molecular abundances for two representative IRDCs --\nIRDC013.90-1 and IRDC321.73-1 -- using the molecular species N$_2$H$^+$,\nHC$_3$N, HNC, HCO$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H, NH$_3$ and CS. IRDC013.90-1 is a cold IRDC,\nwith a temperature below 20 K, while IRDC321.73-1 is somewhat warmer, in the\nrange 20 - 30 K. We find that the complete gas-grain model fits the data very\nwell, but that the goodness-of-fit is not sharply peaked at a particular\ntemperature. Surface processes are important for the explanation of the high\ngas-phase abundance of N$_2$H$^+$ in IRDC321.73-1. The general success of the\n0-D model in reproducing single-dish observations of our limited sample of 8\nspecies shows that it is probably sufficient for an explanation of this type of\ndata.

In the case of weak scattering strength,\nelectron trapping increase the electron density, hereafter boost the\nconductance significantly. Although the increment in conductance would reduce\nthe Seebeck coefficient slightly, the power factor still increases. In the case\nof strong scattering strength, electron diffraction causes the redistribution\nof electrons, accumulation of electron at the ends of the wire blocks current\nflow; hence the conductance is reduced significantly.

Fusion cross\nsections are calculated using time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory coupled with\ndensity-constrained Hartree-Fock calculations to deduce an effective potential.\nSystems studied include 16O+16O, 16O+24O, 24O+24O, 12C+16O, and 12C+24O. We\nfind remarkable agreement with experimental cross sections for the fusion of\nstable nuclei. Our simulations use the SLy4 Skyrme force that has been\npreviously fit to the properties of stable nuclei, and no parameters have been\nfit to fusion data. We compare our results to the simple S\\~{a}o Paulo static\nbarrier penetration model. For the asymmetric systems 12C+24O or 16O+24O we\npredict an order of magnitude larger cross section than those predicted by the\nS\\~{a}o Paulo model. This is likely due to the transfer of neutrons from the\nvery neutron rich nucleus to the stable nucleus and dynamical rearrangements of\nthe nuclear densities during the collision process. These effects are not\nincluded in potential models. This enhancement of fusion cross sections, for\nvery neutron rich nuclei, can be tested in the laboratory with radioactive\nbeams.\n","330925":"  In this paper we are concerned with the global existence of smooth solutions\nto the turbulent flow equations for compressible flows in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.

We identified a process \"ground state alignment\" as a new way to\ndetermine the magnetic field direction in diffuse medium. The alignment is due\nto anisotropic radiation impinging on the atom\/ion, while the magnetic field\ninduces precession and realign the atom\/ion and therefore the polarization of\nthe emitted or absorbed radiation reflects the direction of the magnetic field.\nThe atoms get aligned at their low levels and, as the life-time of the\natoms\/ions we deal with is long, the alignment induced by anisotropic radiation\nis susceptible to weak magnetic fields ($1{\\rm G}\\gtrsim B\\gtrsim 10^{-15}$G).\nCompared to the upper level Hanle effect, atomic realignment is most suitable\nfor the studies of magnetic field in the diffuse medium, where magnetic field\nis relatively weak. In fact, the effects of atomic\/ionic alignment, including\nthe realignment in magnetic field, were studied in the laboratory decades ago,\nmostly in relation to the maser research. Recently, the atomic effect has been\nalready detected in observations from circumstellar medium and this is a\nharbinger of future extensive magnetic field studies. A unique feature of the\natomic realignment is that they can reveal the 3D orientation of magnetic\nfield. In this article, we shall review the basic physical processes involved\nin atomic realignment and its applications to interplanetary, circumstellar and\ninterstellar magnetic fields.

We particularly insist on the implication of two notions of causality\nthat may occur in physical systems. It is well accepted that dynamical\ncausality is assessed by the conditional transfer entropy, a measure appearing\nnaturally as a part of directed information. Surprisingly the notion of\ninstantaneous causality is often overlooked, even if it was clearly understood\nin early works. In the bivariate case, instantaneous coupling is measured\nadequately by the instantaneous information exchange, a measure that\nsupplements the transfer entropy in the decomposition of directed information.\nIn this paper, the focus is put on the multivariate case and conditional graph\nmodeling issues. In this framework, we show that the decomposition of directed\ninformation into the sum of transfer entropy and information exchange does not\nhold anymore. Nevertheless, the discussion allows to put forward the two\nmeasures as pillars for the inference of causality graphs. We illustrate this\non two synthetic examples which allow us to discuss not only the theoretical\nconcepts, but also the practical estimation issues.\n","330932":"  These are notes related to a 12-hour course of lectures given at the Centre\nde Recerca Mathem\\`atica near Barcelona in February, 2010.

We reduce the bipartite network into a unipartite\nnetwork by integrating out OR gates, and obtain the effective branching ratio\nfor the remaining AND gates. Then the standard BP approach is applied to the\nreduced network, and the avalanche size distribution is obtained.

Suspension of\nPANI in silicone oil, a model electrorheological fluid, shows enhancement in\nelastic modulus and yield stress with increase in the magnitude of electric\nfield. Under creep flow field, application of greater magnitude of electric\nfield reduces strain induced in the material while application of greater\nmagnitude of shear stress at any electric field enhances strain induced in the\nmaterial. Remarkably, time evolution of strain in PANI suspension at different\nstresses, electric field strengths and concentrations show superposition after\nappropriate shifting of the creep curves on time and strain axes. Observed\nelectric field - shear stress - creep time - concentration superposition\ndemonstrates self-similarity in electrorheological behavior. We analyze the\nexperimental data using Bingham and Klingenberg - Zukoski model and observe\nthat the latter predicts the experimental behavior very well.

Existence of superposition in an effective time domain facilitates\nprediction of long and very short time rheological behavior. Analysis of the\nobserved behavior from effective time approach suggests that superposition is\npossible only when the shape of a relaxation time spectrum is preserved at\nvarious aging times and stresses. We also observe that creep curves at low\naging times and greater stresses demonstrate delayed but sudden yielding. The\ncritical time, at which material yields, increases with increase in aging time\nand decrease in stress. We argue that local rejuvenation of part of the glassy\nmaterial causes variation in the rate of evolution of relaxation modes.

Multi-wavelength studies were performed combining\noptical absorption line data of CaII and NaI with follow-up HI 21-cm emission\nline observations along 408 sight lines towards low- and high-redshift QSOs. We\nmade use of archival optical spectra obtained with UVES\/VLT. HI data were\nextracted from the Effelsberg-Bonn HI survey and the Galactic All-Sky survey.\nFor selected sight lines we obtained deeper follow-up observations using the\nEffelsberg 100-m telescope. CaII (NaI) halo absorbers at intermediate and high\nradial velocities are present in 40-55% (20-35%) of the sightlines, depending\non the column density threshold chosen. Many halo absorbers show\nmulti-component absorption lines, indicating the presence of sub-structure. In\n65% of the cases, absorption is associated with HI 21-cm emission. The CaII\n(NaI) column density distribution function follows a power-law with a slope of\n-2.2 (-1.4). Our absorption-selected survey confirms our previous results that\nthe Milky Way halo is filled with a large number of neutral gas structures\nwhose high column density tail represents the population of common HI high- and\nintermediate-velocity clouds seen in 21-cm observations. We find that CaII\/NaI\ncolumn density ratios in the halo absorbers are typically smaller than those in\nthe Milky Way disc, in the gas in the Magellanic Clouds, and in damped\nLyman-alpha systems. The small ratios (prominent in particular in high-velocity\ncomponents) indicate a lower level of Ca depletion onto dust grains in Milky\nWay halo absorbers compared to gas in discs and inner regions of galaxies.\n","330963":"  Certain vector-valued inequalities are shown to hold for a Walsh analog of\nthe bilinear Hilbert transform. These extensions are phrased in terms of a\nrecent notion of quartile type of a UMD (Unconditional Martingale Differences)\nBanach space X. Every known UMD Banach space has finite quartile type, and it\nwas recently shown that the Walsh analog of Carleson's Theorem holds under a\nclosely related assumption of finite tile type. For a Walsh model of the\nbilinear Hilbert transform however, the quartile type should be sufficiently\nclose to that of a Hilbert space for our results to hold.

We consider two cases: when the set of\npoints where the ellipticity of the Heat operator fails is included in a\nhypersurface and when it is an open set. In the first case and under special\nassumptions, we prove that the evolution of the energy density is the one of a\ndamped wave equation: propagation along the rays of geometric optic and damping\naccording to a microlocal process. In the second case, we show that the energy\ndensity propagates along rays which are distortions of the rays of geometric\noptic.\n","330966":"  We present pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments which\nenable us to characterize the coupling between bismuth donor spin qubits in Si\nand the surrounding spin bath of 29Si impurities which provides the dominant\ndecoherence mechanism (nuclear spin diffusion) at low temperatures (< 16 K).\nDecoupling from the spin bath is predicted and cluster correlation expansion\nsimulations show near-complete suppression of spin diffusion, at optimal\nworking points. The suppression takes the form of sharply peaked divergences of\nthe spin diffusion coherence time, in contrast with previously identified\nbroader regions of insensitivity to classical fluctuations. ENDOR data suggest\nthat anisotropic contributions are comparatively weak, so the form of the\ndivergences is largely independent of crystal orientation.\n","330967":"  The performance of the LAND neutron detector is studied. Using an\nevent-mixing technique based on one-neutron data obtained in the S107\nexperiment at the GSI laboratory, we test the efficiency of various analytic\ntools used to determine the multiplicity and kinematic properties of detected\nneutrons. A new algorithm developed recently for recognizing neutron showers\nfrom spectator decays in the ALADIN experiment S254 is described in detail. Its\nperformance is assessed in comparison with other methods. The properties of the\nobserved neutron events are used to estimate the detection efficiency of LAND\nin this experiment.\n","330968":"  We apply Dirac's gauge fixing procedure to Chern-Simons theory with gauge\ngroup ISO(2,1) on manifolds RxS, where S is a punctured oriented surface of\ngeneral genus. For all gauge fixing conditions that satisfy certain structural\nrequirements, this yields an explicit description of the Poisson structure on\nthe moduli space of flat ISO(2,1)-connections on S via the resulting Dirac\nbracket. The Dirac bracket is determined by classical dynamical r-matrices for\nISO(2,1). We show that the Poisson structures and classical dynamical\nr-matrices arising from different gauge fixing conditions are related by\ndynamical ISO(2,1)-valued transformations that generalise the usual gauge\ntransformations of classical dynamical r-matrices. By means of these\ntransformations, it is possible to classify all Poisson structures and\nclassical dynamical r-matrices obtained from such gauge fixings. Generically\nthese Poisson structures combine classical dynamical r-matrices for\nnon-conjugate Cartan subalgebras of iso(2,1).\n","330969":"  This review traces the evolution of theory that started when Charles Stein in\n1955 [In Proc. 3rd Berkeley Sympos.

The\ndominating estimators, referred to here as being \"Model-I minimax,\" can be\nfound by shrinking the sample means toward any constant vector. Admissible\nminimax shrinkage estimators were derived by Stein and others as posterior\nmeans based on a random effects model, \"Model-II\" here, wherein the $\\mu_i$\nvalues have their own distributions. Section 2 centers on Figure 2, which\norganizes a wide class of priors on the unknown Level-II hyperparameters that\nhave been proved to yield admissible Model-I minimax shrinkage estimators in\nthe \"equal variance case.\" Putting a flat prior on the Level-II variance is\nunique in this class for its scale-invariance and for its conjugacy, and it\ninduces Stein's harmonic prior (SHP) on $\\mu_i$.\n","330970":"  We carry out some computations of vector valued Siegel modular forms of\ndegree two, weight (k,2) and level one. Our approach is based on Satoh's\ndescription of the module of vector-valued Siegel modular forms of weight (k,\n2) and an explicit description of the Hecke action on Fourier expansions. We\nhighlight three experimental results: (1) we identify a rational eigenform in a\nthree dimensional space of cusp forms, (2) we observe that non-cuspidal\neigenforms of level one are not always rational and (3) we verify a number of\ncases of conjectures about congruences between classical modular forms and\nSiegel modular forms.\n","330971":"  A general critical condition of subharmonic oscillation in terms of the loop\ngain is derived. Many closed-form critical conditions for various control\nschemes in terms of converter parameters are also derived. Some previously\nknown critical conditions become special cases in the generalized framework.\nGiven an arbitrary control scheme, a systematic procedure is proposed to derive\nthe critical condition for that control scheme. Different control schemes share\nsimilar forms of critical conditions. For example, both V2 control and voltage\nmode control have the same form of critical condition. A peculiar phenomenon in\naverage current mode control where subharmonic oscillation occurs in a window\nvalue of pole can be explained by the derived critical condition. A ripple\namplitude index to predict subharmonic oscillation proposed in the past\nresearch has limited application and is shown invalid for a converter with a\nlarge pole.\n","330972":"  Between 2007 and 2010 Virgo collected data in coincidence with the LIGO and\nGEO gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. These data have been searched for GWs\nemitted by cataclysmic phenomena in the universe, by non-axisymmetric rotating\nneutron stars or from a stochastic background in the frequency band of the\ndetectors. The sensitivity of GW searches is limited by noise produced by the\ndetector or its environment. It is therefore crucial to characterize the\nvarious noise sources in a GW detector. This paper reviews the Virgo detector\nnoise sources, noise propagation, and conversion mechanisms which were\nidentified in the three first Virgo observing runs. In many cases, these\ninvestigations allowed us to mitigate noise sources in the detector, or to\nselectively flag noise events and discard them from the data. We present\nexamples from the joint LIGO-GEO-Virgo GW searches to show how well noise\ntransients and narrow spectral lines have been identified and excluded from the\nVirgo data. We also discuss how detector characterization can improve the\nastrophysical reach of gravitational-wave searches.\n","330973":"  Reliable encoding of information in quantum systems is crucial to all\napproaches to quantum information processing or communication. This applies in\nparticular to photons used in linear optics quantum computing (LOQC), which is\nscalable provided a deterministic single-photon emission and preparation is\navailable. Here, we show that narrowband photons deterministically emitted from\nan atom-cavity system fulfill these requirements. Within their 500 ns coherence\ntime, we demonstrate a subdivision into d time bins of various amplitudes and\nphases, which we use for encoding arbitrary qu-d-its. The latter is done\ndeterministically with a fidelity >95% for qubits, verified using a newly\ndeveloped time-resolved quantum-homodyne method.\n","330974":"  Atmospheric emission is a dominant source of disturbance in ground-based\nastronomy at mm wavelengths. The Antarctic plateau is recognized to be an ideal\nsite for mm and sub-mm observations, and the French\/Italian base of Dome C is\namong the best sites on Earth for these observations. In this paper we present\nmeasurements, performed using the BRAIN-pathfinder experiment, at Dome C of the\natmospheric emission in intensity and polarization at 150GHz, one of the best\nobservational frequencies for CMB observations when considering cosmic signal\nintensity, atmospheric transmission, detectors sensitivity, and foreground\nremoval. Careful characterization of the air-mass synchronous emission has been\nperformed, acquiring more that 380 elevation scans (i.e. \"skydip\") during the\nthird BRAIN-pathfinder summer campaign in December 2009\/January 2010. The\nextremely high transparency of the Antarctic atmosphere over Dome Concordia is\nproven by the very low measured optical depth: <tau_I>=0.050 \\pm 0.003 \\pm\n0.011 where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic error.\nMid term stability, over the summer campaign, of the atmosphere emission has\nalso been studied. Adapting the radiative transfer atmosphere emission model\n\"am\" to the particular conditions found at Dome C, we also infer the level of\nthe PWV content of the atmosphere, notoriously the main source of disturbance\nin millimetric astronomy (<PWV>=0.77 +\/- 0.06 + 0.15 - 0.12 mm). Upper limits\non the air-mass correlated polarized signal are also placed for the first time.\nThe degree of circular polarization of atmospheric emission is found to be\nlower than 0.2% (95%CL), while the degree of linear polarization is found to be\nlower than 0.1% (95%CL). These limits include signal-correlated instrumental\nspurious polarization.\n","330975":"  We determine all posible orders of automorphisms of finite order of complex\nK3 surfaces or of K3 surfaces in characteristic $p>3$.

In particular, 66 is the\nmaximum finite order in each characteristic $p\\neq 2,3$.

We here\ndescribe these parallels emphasizing the focus on Bayes procedures and the\nderivation of the superharmonic conditions for minimaxity as well as further\ndevelopments of new minimax shrinkage predictive density estimators including\nmultiple shrinkage estimators, empirical Bayes estimators, normal linear model\nregression estimators and nonparametric regression estimators.\n","330977":"  We study the low-energy bandstructure of armchair and small-bandgap\nsemiconducting carbon nanotubes with proximity-induced superconducting pairing\nwhen a spiral magnetic field creates strong effective spin-orbit interactions\nfrom the Zeeman term and a periodic potential from the orbital part.

We consider random forces with the\nstatistics of random walks and reduce the problem to a single degree of\nfreedom. It is the extension of the mean field ABBM model in presence of an\ninertial mass m. While the ABBM model can be solved exactly, its extension to\ninertia exhibits complicated history dependence due to oscillations and\nbackward motion. The characteristic scales for avalanche motion are studied\nfrom numerics and qualitative arguments. To make analytical progress we\nconsider two variants which coincide with the original model whenever the\nparticle moves only forward. Using a combination of analytical and numerical\nmethods together with simulations, we characterize the distributions of\ninstantaneous acceleration and velocity, and compare them in these three\nmodels. We show that for large driving velocity, all three models share the\nsame large-deviation function for positive velocities, which is obtained\nanalytically for small and large m, as well as for m =6\/25.

We first present a detailed\nintroduction to generalized probabilistic theories before we examine new\napproaches towards a physical axiomatization of quantum theory. The main result\nof the thesis is that one postulate concerning post-measurement states (which\nhave gained almost no attention in this context so far) is sufficient to rule\nout all probabilistic theories with a polytopic state space, except for\nclassical theory. The postulate states that a measurement with a definite\noutcome does not alter the state. This rules out almost all toy theories\nconsidered so far, for instance the PR-box, but is compatible with quantum\ntheory. Thus, this result can be seen as an approach towards a classification\nof quantum theory in physical terms. It only deals with local state spaces, in\ncontrast to other approaches that are mostly concerned with nonlocality in\ncomposite systems.\n","330982":"  In this paper, we present a general theory of motion planning for kinematic\nsystems. This theory has been developed for long by one of the authors in a\nprevious series of papers. It is mostly based upon concepts from subriemannian\ngeometry.

We show that up to\ntaking a subsequence, and after rescaling by the diameter, the sequence $(X_n)$\nconverges in the Gromov Hausdorff distance to a torus of dimension $<q$,\nequipped with some invariant Finsler metric. The proof relies on a recent\nquantitative version of Gromov's theorem on groups with polynomial growth\nobtained by Breuillard, Green and Tao. If $X_n$ is only roughly transitive and\n$|X_n| = o\\bigl({diam(X_n)^{\\delta}}\\bigr)$ for $\\delta > 1$ sufficiently\nsmall, we prove, this time by elementary means, that $(X_n)$ converges to a\ncircle.\n","330984":"  We prove a uniformly continuous linear extension principle in topological\nvector spaces from which we derive a very short and canonical construction of\nthe Lebesgue integral of Banach space valued maps on a finite measure space.\nThe Vitali Convergence Theorem and the Riesz-Fischer Theorem are shown to\nfollow as easy consequences from our construction.\n","330985":"  The Reverse Stein Effect is identified and illustrated: A statistician who\nshrinks his\/her data toward a point chosen without reliable knowledge about the\nunderlying value of the parameter to be estimated but based instead upon the\nobserved data will not be protected by the minimax property of shrinkage\nestimators such as that of James and Stein, but instead will likely incur a\ngreater error than if shrinkage were not used.\n","330986":"  We explore the phase diagram of the SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in 5 dimensions\nby numerical simulations. The lattice system shows a dimensionally-reduced\nphase where the extra dimension is small compared to the four dimensional\ncorrelation length. In the low-energy regime of this phase, the system behaves\nlike a four-dimensional gauge theory coupled to an adjoint scalar field. By\ntuning the bare parameters of the lattice model, we identify lines of constant\nphysics, and analyse the behaviour of the non-perturbative scalar mass as a\nfunction of the compactification and the cut-off scales. The perturbative\nprediction that the effective theory contains a light particle with a mass that\nis independent of the cut-off is tested against non-pertubative results.\n","330987":"  Thermoelectric effects in spintronics are gathering increasing attention as a\nmeans of managing heat in nanoscale structures and of controlling spin\ninformation by using heat flow. Thermal magnons (spin-wave quanta) are expected\nto play a major role, however, little is known about the underlying physical\nmechanisms involved. The reason is the lack of information about magnon\ninteractions and of reliable methods to obtain it, in particular for electrical\nconductors because of the intricate influence of electrons. Here, we\ndemonstrate a conceptually new device that allows us to gather information on\nmagnon-electron scattering and magnon-drag effects. The device resembles a\nthermopile formed by a large number of pairs of ferromagnetic wires placed\nbetween a hot and a cold source and connected thermally in parallel and\nelectrically in series. By controlling the relative orientation of the\nmagnetization in pairs of wires, the magnon-drag can be studied independently\nof the electron and phonon-drag thermoelectric effects. Measurements as a\nfunction of temperature reveal the effect on magnon drag following a variation\nof magnon and phonon populations. This information is crucial to understand the\nphysics of electron-magnon interactions, magnon dynamics and thermal spin\ntransport.\n","330988":"  We investigate two-species bosons in a two-dimensional square lattice by\nquantum Monte Carlo method.

The quantum and thermal transitions out of the pair-supersolid phase are\ncharacterized. It is found that there is a direct first order transition from\nthe pair-supersolid phase to the double-superfluid phase without an\nintermediate region. Furthermore, the melting of the pair-supersolid occurs in\ntwo steps. Upon heating, first the pair-superfluid is destroyed via a KT\ntransition then the solid order melts via an Ising transition\n","330989":"  Quantum walk acts obviously different from its classical counterpart, but\ndecoherence will lessen and close the gap between them. To understand this\nprocess, it is necessary to investigate the evolution of quantum walk under\ndifferent situation of decoherence. In this article, we study a non-Markovian\ndecoherent quantum walk on a line. In the short time regime, the behavior of\nthe walk deviates from both idea quantum walks and classical random walks. The\nposition variance as a measure of quantum walk starts oscillating from the\nfirst several steps and tends to be linear on time and showing a diffusive\nspread in the long time limit, which is caused by the non-Markovian dephasing\naffecting on quantum correlations between quantum walker and his coin. We also\nstudy both quantum discord and measurement-induced disturbance as measures of\nquantum correlations and observe that both of them oscillate in the short time\nregime and tend to be zero in the long time limit. Therefore quantum walk with\nnon-Markovian decoherence tends to diffusive spreading behavior in the long\ntime limit, while in the short time regime it oscillates between a ballistic\nand diffusive spreading behavior, and the quantum correlation collapses and\nrevivals due to the memory effect.\n","330990":"  Issues of Ge hut cluster nucleation and growth at low temperatures on the\nGe\/Si(001) wetting layer are discussed on the basis of explorations performed\nby high resolution STM and in-situ RHEED.

Assuming the magnetic field to be strong, the chiral condensate and the\n\\textit{local} electric current correlation function are computed in the lowest\nLandau level (LLL) approximation and the results are compared with those\narising from a strong homogeneous magnetic field.

Due to the large\nfree-streaming length in the scenario of warm WIMPs, the substructure contend\nof the dark matter halo is significantly different from that of the cold WIMP\ncounterpart, resulting in distinct predictions of the $\\gamma$-ray signals from\nthe dark matter annihilation. We illustrate these by comparing the predicted\n$\\gamma$-ray signals from the warm WIMP annihilation to that of cold WIMPs.\nPronounced differences from the subhalo skymap and statistical properties\nbetween two WIMP models are demonstrated. Due to the potentially enhanced cross\nsection of the non-thermal production mechanism in warm WIMP scenario, the\nGalactic center might be prior for the indirect detection of warm WIMPs to\ndwarf galaxies, which might be different from the cold dark matter scenario.

The \"single crossing point\" property is with respect to the\nsnr (as in the scalar case). ii) The channel matrix is arbitrary, the Gaussian\ninput is limited to an independent Gaussian input.
