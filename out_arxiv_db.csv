unprecedented access to public opinion on elections, news, movies etc. However,
caution must be taken to determine whether and how much of the opinion

that the Twitter users can be characteristically different from general users,
both in their rating and their relative preference for Oscar-nominated and

variability and improving quality. Most of the engineering statistics
literature mainly focuses on finding ""point estimates"" of the optimum operating
conditions for robust design. Various procedures for calculating point
estimates of the optimum operating conditions are considered. Although this
point estimation procedure is important for continuous quality improvement, the
immediate question is ""how accurate are these optimum operating conditions?""
The answer for this is to consider interval estimation for a single variable or
joint confidence regions for multiple variables.
  In this paper, with the help of the bootstrap technique, we develop
procedures for obtaining joint ""confidence regions"" for the optimum operating
conditions. Two different procedures using Bonferroni and multivariate normal
approximation are introduced. The proposed methods are illustrated and
substantiated using a numerical example.

and its determination through the angle resolved photo-emission spectroscopy
(ARPES) is discussed in detail. There are two schools of thoughts about the
pairing glue question: One argues that superconductivity in the cuprates
emerges out of doping the spin singlet resonating valence bond (RVB) state.
Since singlet pairs are already formed in the RVB state there is no need for
additional boson glue to pair the electrons. The other instead suggests that
the d-wave pairs are mediated by the collective bosons like the conventional
low $T_c$ SC with the alteration that the phonons are replaced by another kind
of bosons ranging from the antiferromagnetic (AF) to loop current fluctuations.
An approach to resolve this dispute is to determine the frequency and momentum
dependences of the diagonal and off-diagonal self-energies directly from
experiments like the McMillan-Rowell procedure for the conventional SC. In that
a simple d-wave BCS theory describes superconducting properties of the cuprates
well, the Eliashberg analysis of well designed high resolution experimental
data will yield the crucial frequency and momentum dependences of the
self-energies. This line of approach using ARPES are discussed in more detail
in this review, and some remaining problems are commented.

inflation model building, yet constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background
measurements alone are insufficient to place bounds stringent enough to be
appreciably effective. For the very small scale spectrum, those which subtend
angles of less than 0.3 degrees on the sky, an upper bound can be extracted
from the astrophysical constraints on the possible production of primordial
black holes in the early universe. A recently discovered observational
by-product of an enhanced power spectrum on small scales, induced gravitational
waves, have been shown to be within the range of proposed space based
gravitational wave detectors; such as NASA's LISA and BBO detectors, and the
Japanese DECIGO detector. In this paper we explore the impact such a detection
would have on models of inflation known to lead to an enhanced power spectrum
on small scales, namely the Hilltop-type and running mass models. We find that
the Hilltop-type model can produce observable induced gravitational waves
within the range of BBO and DECIGO for integral and fractional powers of the
potential within a reasonable number of e-folds. We also find that the running
mass model can produce a spectrum within the range of these detectors, but
require that inflation terminates after an unreasonably small number of
e-folds. Finally, we argue that if the thermal history of the Universe were to
accomodate such a small number of e-folds the Running Mass Model can produce
Primordial Black Holes within a mass range compatible with Dark Matter, i.e.
within a mass range 10^{20}g< M_{BH}<10^{27}g.

cell shape change and tissue deformation. Recent experiments on reconstituted
actomyosin networks, the major component of the contractile machinery, have
shown that active contractility occurs above a threshold motor concentration
and within a window of crosslink concentration. We present a microscopic
dynamic model that incorporates two essential aspects of actomyosin
self-organization: the asymmetric load response of individual actin filaments
and the correlated motor-driven events mimicking myosin-induced filament
sliding. Using computer simulations we examine how the concentration and
susceptibility of motors contribute to their collective behavior and interplay
with the network connectivity to regulate macroscopic contractility. Our model
is shown to capture the formation and dynamics of contractile structures and
agree with the observed dependence of active contractility on microscopic
parameters including the contractility onset. Cooperative action of
load-resisting motors in a force-percolating structure integrates local
contraction/buckling events into a global contractile state via an active
coarsening process, in contrast to the flow transition driven by uncorrelated
kicks of susceptible motors.

showing that, modulo polynomial reductions, computations of Turing machines can

distributions for ground and excited states of $^{57}$Zn are calculated in the
domain of proton-neutron Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (pn-QRPA)
theory. No experimental insertions were made (as usually made in other pn-QRPA
calculations of B(GT) strength function) to check the performance of the model
for proton-rich nuclei. The calculated ground-state B(GT) strength distribution
is in good agreement with measurements and shows differences with the earlier
reported shell model calculation. The pn-QRPA model reproduced the measured
low-lying strength for $^{57}$Zn better in comparison to the KB3G interaction
used in the large-scale shell model calculation. The stellar weak rates are
sensitive to the location and structure of these low-lying states in daughter
$^{57}$Cu. The primary mechanism for producing such nuclei is the rp-process
and is believed to be important in the dynamics of the collapsing supermassive
stars. Small changes in the binding and excitation energies can lead to
significant modifications of the predictions for the synthesis of proton rich
isotopes. The $\beta^{+}$-decay and electron capture (EC) rates on $^{57}$Zn
are compared to the seminal work of Fuller, Fowler and Newman (FFN). The
pn-QRPA calculated $\beta^{+}$-decay rates are generally in good agreement with
the FFN calculation. However at high stellar temperatures the calculated
$\beta^{+}$-decay rates are almost half of FFN rates. On the other hand, for
rp-process conditions, the calculated electron capture ($\beta^{+}$-decay)
rates are bigger than FFN rates by more than a factor 2 (1.5) and may have
interesting astrophysical consequences.

InGaAs self-assembled quantum dots. Our results reveal surface plasmon
propagation lengths ranging from 13.4 {\pm} 1.7 {\mu}m to 27.5 {\pm} 1.5 {\mu}m
as the width of the waveguide increases from 2-5 {\mu}m. Experiments performed
on active structures containing near surface quantum dots clearly show that the
propagating plasmon mode excites the dot, providing a new method to spatially
image the surface plasmon mode. We use low temperature confocal microscopy with
polarization control in the excitation and detection channel. After excitation,
plasmons propagate along the waveguide and are scattered into the far field at
the end. By comparing length and width evolution of the waveguide losses we
determine the plasmon propagation length to be 27.5 {\pm} 1.5 {\mu}m at 830 nm
(for a width of 5 {\mu}m), reducing to 13.4 {\pm} 1.7 {\mu}m for a width of 2

precisely controlled distance 7-120 nm from the Au-GaAs interface, we probed
the mutual coupling between the quantum dot and plasmon mode. These
investigations reveal a unidirectional energy transfer from the propagating
surface plasmon to the quantum dot. The exquisite control of the position and

on-chip generation and guiding of single plasmons for future applications in
nanoscale quantum optics operating below the diffraction limit.

positron capture rates for these isotopes of iron are also calculated in
stellar matter. These calculations were recently introduced and this paper is a
follow-up which discusses in detail the GT strength distributions and stellar
capture rates of key iron isotopes. The calculations are performed within the
framework of the proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation
(pn-QRPA) theory. The pn-QRPA theory allows a microscopic
\textit{state-by-state} calculation of GT strength functions and stellar
capture rates which greatly increases the reliability of the results. For the
first time experimental deformation of nuclei are taken into account. In the
core of massive stars isotopes of iron, $^{54,55,56}$Fe, are considered to be
key players in decreasing the electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{e}$) mainly via
electron capture on these nuclide. The structure of the presupernova star is
altered both by the changes in $Y_{e}$ and the entropy of the core material.
Results are encouraging and are compared against measurements (where possible)
and other calculations. The calculated electron capture rates are in overall
good agreement with the shell model results. During the presupernova evolution
of massive stars, from oxygen shell burning stages till around end of
convective core silicon burning, the calculated electron capture rates on
$^{54}$Fe are around three times bigger than the corresponding shell model
rates. The calculated positron capture rates, however, are suppressed by two to
five orders of magnitude.

certain conditions, leading to a ""Bosenova"". We model the dynamics of such

to the Anderson metal-insulator transition (AMIT). Critical Power law
correlations between electron wave functions at different energies in the
vicinity of the AMIT result in the formation of pseudogaps of the local density
of states. Magnetic impurities can remain unscreened at such sites. We
determine the density of the resulting free magnetic moments in the zero
temperature limit. While it is finite on the insulating side of the AMIT, it
vanishes at the AMIT, and decays with a power law as function of the distance
to the AMIT. Since the fluctuating spins of these free magnetic moments break
the time reversal symmetry of the conduction electrons, we find a shift of the
AMIT, and the appearance of a semimetal phase. The distribution function of the
Kondo temperature $T_{K}$ is derived at the AMIT, in the metallic phase and in
the insulator phase. This allows us to find the quantum phase diagram in an
external magnetic field $B$ and at finite temperature $T$. We calculate the
resulting magnetic susceptibility, the specific heat, and the spin relaxation
rate as function of temperature. We find a phase diagram with finite
temperature transitions between insulator, critical semimetal, and metal
phases. These new types of phase transitions are caused by the interplay
between Kondo screening and Anderson localization, with the latter being
shifted by the appearance of the temperature-dependent spin-flip scattering
rate. Accordingly, we name them Kondo-Anderson transitions (KATs).

low-cost deployment. In addition, the WSNs use data-centric multi-hop

being at the application layer, as in general networks. Therefore, an
energy-efficient link layer security framework is necessitated. There do exists
a number of link layer security architectures that offer some combinations of

in-network processing, which aims at reducing effectively, the total number of

largely employs data aggregation operations that aggregate the data into a
compact representation for further transmission. However, due to the ubiquitous

due to the stringent resource constraints in WSN nodes, the security concerns

complex dynamical systems. {While there are already many successful
applications ranging from medicine to paleoclimatology, a solid theoretical
foundation of the method has still been missing so far. Here, we interpret an
$\varepsilon$-recurrence network as a discrete subnetwork of a ""continuous""
graph with uncountably many vertices and edges corresponding to the system's
attractor. This step allows us to show that various statistical measures
commonly used in complex network analysis can be seen as discrete estimators of
newly defined continuous measures of certain complex geometric properties of
the attractor on the scale given by $\varepsilon$.} In particular, we introduce
local measures such as the $\varepsilon$-clustering coefficient, mesoscopic
measures such as $\varepsilon$-motif density, path-based measures such as
$\varepsilon$-betweennesses, and global measures such as
$\varepsilon$-efficiency. This new analytical basis for the so far
heuristically motivated network measures also provides an objective criterion
for the choice of $\varepsilon$ via a percolation threshold, and it shows that
estimation can be improved by so-called node splitting invariant versions of
the measures. We finally illustrate the framework for a number of archetypical
chaotic attractors such as those of the Bernoulli and logistic maps, periodic
and two-dimensional quasi-periodic motions, and for hyperballs and hypercubes,
by deriving analytical expressions for the novel measures and comparing them
with data from numerical experiments. More generally, the theoretical framework
put forward in this work describes random geometric graphs and other networks
with spatial constraints which appear frequently in disciplines ranging from
biology to climate science.

importance in the design of any dose monitoring device and is eagerly needed to

secondary particles produced from the interaction of a 80 MeV/u fully stripped

Poly-methyl methacrylate target. Charged secondary particles, produced at
90$\degree$ with respect to the beam axis, have been tracked with a drift
chamber, while their energy and time of flight has been measured by means of a
LYSO scintillator. Secondary protons have been identified exploiting the energy
and time of flight information, and their emission region has been
reconstructed backtracking from the drift chamber to the target. Moreover a
position scan of the target indicates that the reconstructed emission region
follows the movement of the expected Bragg peak position. Exploting the
reconstruction of the emission region, an accuracy on the Bragg peak
determination in the submillimeter range has been obtained. The measured

polar anisotropy and an East-West asymmetry of P-wave velocity and attenuation.
Anisotropy is expected if shear deformation is induced by convective motions.
Translation has recently been put forward as an important mode of convection of
the inner core. Combined with a simple diffusive grain growth model, this
mechanism is able to explain the observed seismic asymmetry, but not the bulk
anisotropy. The source of anisotropy has therefore to be sought in the shear
motions caused by higher modes of convection. Using a hybrid finite-difference
spherical harmonics Navier-Stokes solver, we investigate the interplay between
translation and convection in a 3D spherical model with permeable boundary
conditions at the inner core boundary. Three parameters act independently:
viscosity, internal heating and convection velocity in the outer core. Our
numerical simulations show the dominance of pure translation for viscosities of
the inner core higher than $10^{20}$ Pas. Translation is almost completely
hampered by convective motions for viscosities lower than $10^{18}$ Pas.
Between these values, translation and convection develop, but convective
downwellings are restricted to the coldest hemisphere where crystallization
occurs. On the opposite side, shear is almost absent, thereby allowing grain
growth. We propose that the coexistence of translation and convection observed
in our numerical models leads to a seismic asymmetry but localizes deformation
only in one hemisphere.

applied. These analytical results are capable to predict propagation failure,
velocity overshoot, and the asymptotic value for the front velocity in the
limit of large period lengths in qualitative, often quantitative agreement with

mass conservation becomes essential. As opposed to the strategy that handles
weakly this transmission condition through a Lagrange multiplier, we impose
here this restriction exactly in the space of global velocity field. Our
analysis of the Galerkin discretization of the resulting problem reveals that,
if the mixed finite element space used in the Darcy domain admits an
$\mathbf{H}(\text{div})$-stable discrete lifting of the normal trace, then it
can be combined with any stable Stokes mixed finite element of the same order
to deliver a stable global method with quasi-optimal convergence rate. Finally,
we present a series of numerical tests confirming our theoretical convergence
estimates.

investigated. A pseudostate (PS) basis is used to represent the states of the
composite system. This PS basis is obtained by diagonalizing the system
Hamiltonian in a family of square integrable functions. In this work the
Transformed Harmonic Oscillator (THO) functions, obtained from the solutions of
the Harmonic Oscillator using a Local Scale Transformation (LST), are used. The
proposed method is applied to the 11Be nucleus, treated in a two-body model
(10Be+n). Both structure and reaction observables have been studied.
  Wavefunctions and energies obtained for the bound states and some low-lying
resonances are compared with those obtained by direct integration of the
Schroedinger equation. The dipole and quadrupole electric transition
probabilities for the low-energy continuum have been calculated in the THO
basis, and compared with the exact distributions obtained with the scattering
states. Finally, the method is applied to describe the 11Be states in the
Coulomb breakup of 11Be+208Pb at 69 MeV/nucleon. The energy and angular
distributions of the exclusive breakup have been calculated using the
Equivalent Photon Method, including both E1 and E2 contributions. The
calculated distributions are found to be in good agreement with the available
experimental data from RIKEN [Phys. Rev. C70, 054606]. At the very forward
angles, the cross section is completely dominated by the dipole couplings.

luminosity, and find that the previously long held assumption of a relationship
between luminosities at radio and X-ray wavelengths is linear in nature when
bona fide FR-I radio galaxies are considered. In addition, we attempt to
constrain properties which may play a key role in determination of the diffuse
emission process. We test a simple model in which large-scale magnetic field
variations are primarily responsible for determining jet properties; however,

research of microbial metabolic networks. In particular, the information about
a cellular objective is needed in flux balance analysis which is a commonly
used constrained-based metabolic network analysis method for the prediction of
cellular phenotypes. The cellular objective may vary depending on the organism
and its growth conditions. It is probable that nutritionally scarce conditions
are very common in the nature and, in order to survive in those conditions,
cells exhibit various highly efficient nutrient processing systems like
enzymes. In this study, we explore the efficiency of a metabolic network in
transformation of substrates to new biomass, and we introduce a new objective
function simulating growth efficiency.
  We examined the properties of growth efficiency using a metabolic model for
Eschericia coli. We found that the maximal growth efficiency is obtained at a
finite nutrient uptake rate. The rate is substrate-dependent and it typically
does not exceed 20 mmol/h/gDW. We further examined whether the maximal growth
efficiency could serve as a cellular objective function in metabolic network
analysis, and found that cellular growth in batch cultivation can be predicted
reasonably well under this assumption. The fit to experimental data was found
slightly better than with the commonly used objective function of maximal
growth rate.
  Based on our results, we suggest that the maximal growth efficiency can be
considered as a plausible optimization criterion in metabolic modeling for E.
coli. In the future, it would be interesting to study growth efficiency as a
cellular objective also in other cellular systems and under different
cultivation conditions.

detectable in external galaxies, and may ideally serve as kinematic tracers of
Galactic structure. Some RSGs are surrounded by circumstellar envelopes
detectable by their dust and molecular and, in particular, maser emission. This
study consists of a search for maser emission from silicon monoxide (SiO)
toward a significant number of RSGs that are members of massive stellar
clusters, many of which have only recently been discovered. Further, we aim to
relate the occurrence of maser action to properties of the host stars.
  Methods. Using the IRAM 30 meter telescope, we searched for maser emission in
the J = 2 - 1 rotational transition within the first vibrationally excited
state of SiO toward a sample of 88 RSGs.
  Results. With an average rms noise level of 0.25 Jy, we detected maser
emission in 15% of the sample, toward most of the sources for the first time in
this transition. The peak of the emission provides accurate radial velocities
for the RSGs. The dependence of the detection rate on infrared colors supports
a radiative pumping mechanism for the SiO masers.

thermodynamic equilibrium. The ""infinite"" parton matter is simulated by a
system of quarks and gluons within a cubic box with periodic boundary
conditions, at different energy densities, initialized slightly out of kinetic
and chemical equilibrium. We investigate the approach of the system to
equilibrium and the time scales for the equilibration of different observables.
We, furthermore, study particle distributions in the strongly interacting
quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) including partonic spectral functions, momentum
distributions, abundances of the different parton species and their
fluctuations (scaled variance, skewness, and kurtosis) in equilibrium. We also
compare the results of the microscopic calculations with the ansatz of the
DQPM. It is found that the results of the transport calculations are in
equilibrium well matched by the DQPM for quarks and antiquarks, while the gluon
spectral function shows a slightly different shape due to the explicit
interaction of partons. The time scales for the relaxation of fluctuation
observables are found to be shorter than those for the average values.
Furthermore, in the local subsystem, a strong change of the fluctuation
observables with the size of the local volume is observed. These fluctuations
no longer correspond to those of the full system and are reduced to Poissonian
distributions when the volume of the local subsystem becomes much smaller than

high-dimensional data. Historically and conceptually a key development toward
this was the discovery of the inadmissibility of the usual estimator of a
multivariate normal mean. This article develops a geometrical explanation for
this inadmissibility. By exploiting the spherical symmetry of the problem it is
possible to effectively conceptualize the multidimensional setting in a
two-dimensional framework that can be easily plotted and geometrically
analyzed. We begin with the heuristic explanation for inadmissibility that was
given by Stein [In Proceedings of the Third Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical
Statistics and Probability, 1954--1955, Vol. I (1956) 197--206, Univ.
California Press]. Some geometric figures are included to make this reasoning
more tangible. It is also explained why Stein's argument falls short of
yielding a proof of inadmissibility, even when the dimension, $p$, is much
larger than $p=3$. We then extend the geometric idea to yield increasingly
persuasive arguments for inadmissibility when $p\geq3$, albeit at the cost of
increased geometric and computational detail.

differential manifolds. They have been studied extensively in recent years,
both from algebraic operadic points of view and through numerous applications
in numerical analysis, control theory, stochastic differential equations and
renormalization. Butcher series are formal power series founded on pre-Lie
algebras, used in numerical analysis to study geometric properties of flows on
euclidean spaces. Motivated by the analysis of flows on manifolds and
homogeneous spaces, we investigate algebras arising from flat connections with
constant torsion, leading to the definition of post-Lie algebras, a
generalization of pre-Lie algebras. Whereas pre-Lie algebras are intimately
associated with euclidean geometry, post-Lie algebras occur naturally in the
differential geometry of homogeneous spaces, and are also closely related to
Cartan's method of moving frames. Lie--Butcher series combine Butcher series
with Lie series and are used to analyze flows on manifolds. In this paper we
show that Lie--Butcher series are founded on post-Lie algebras. The functorial
relations between post-Lie algebras and their enveloping algebras, called
D-algebras, are explored. Furthermore, we develop new formulas for computations
in free post-Lie algebras and D-algebras, based on recursions in a magma, and
we show that Lie--Butcher series are related to invariants of curves described
by moving frames.

  appear in Theory of Computing; Proceedings of ACM STOC 2012",,,,quant-ph cs.CC,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Forty years ago, Wiesner pointed out that quantum mechanics raises the
striking possibility of money that cannot be counterfeited according to the
laws of physics. We propose the first quantum money scheme that is (1)
public-key, meaning that anyone can verify a banknote as genuine, not only the
bank that printed it, and (2) cryptographically secure, under a ""classical""
hardness assumption that has nothing to do with quantum money. Our scheme is
based on hidden subspaces, encoded as the zero-sets of random multivariate
polynomials. A main technical advance is to show that the ""black-box"" version
of our scheme, where the polynomials are replaced by classical oracles, is
unconditionally secure. Previously, such a result had only been known relative
to a quantum oracle (and even there, the proof was never published). Even in
Wiesner's original setting -- quantum money that can only be verified by the
bank -- we are able to use our techniques to patch a major security hole in
Wiesner's scheme. We give the first private-key quantum money scheme that
allows unlimited verifications and that remains unconditionally secure, even if
the counterfeiter can interact adaptively with the bank. Our money scheme is
simpler than previous public-key quantum money schemes, including a knot-based
scheme of Farhi et al. The verifier needs to perform only two tests, one in the
standard basis and one in the Hadamard basis -- matching the original intuition
for quantum money, based on the existence of complementary observables. Our
security proofs use a new variant of Ambainis's quantum adversary method, and
several other tools that might be of independent interest.

discuss the case where the triangular clusters are coupled via intermediate

the exact ground states; finite-temperature properties are computed exactly by
an additional transfer-matrix step. A detailed analysis reveals a large variety
of ground states at magnetization M equal to fractions 0, 1/4, and 1/2 of the
saturation magnetization M=1. Some of these ground states break translational
symmetry spontaneously and give rise to doubling of the unit cell. In a second

on the orthogonal-dimer chain. We analyze several examples of T=0 magnetization
curves, entropy as a function of temperature T and magnetic field, and the
associated magnetic cooling rate. Comparison of the two models shows that in
certain situations the simplified exactly solvable model yields a qualitatively
or sometimes even quantitatively accurate description of the more challenging
quantum model, including a case which may be relevant to experimental
observations of an enhanced magnetocaloric effect in the two-dimensional

which is a constant fraction of the total energy per half-mass relaxation time.
According to Henon's predictions, this flow is independent of the precise
mechanisms for energy production within the core, and therefore does not
require a complete description of the many-body interactions therein. For a
cluster of equal-mass stars, we thence use dynamical theory and analytic
descriptions of escape mechanisms to construct a series of coupled differential
equations expressing the time evolution of cluster mass and radius. These
equations are numerically solved using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration
kernel, and the results benchmarked against a data base of direct N-body
simulations. We use simulations containing a modest initial number of stars

Mendeley and Web of Science citation, but many altmetric indicators seem to
measure impact mostly orthogonal to citation. Articles cluster in ways that
suggest five different impact ""flavors"", capturing impacts of different types

$u\in \R^M$ of a vector $\bestsignal\in \R^N$ in high-dimensions through a
matrix $\Phi \in \R^{M\times N}$ $(M<N)$. We assume this vector can be well
approximated by $K$ non-zero coefficients (i.e., it is $K$-sparse). In
addition, the nonzero coefficients of $\bestsignal$ can obey additional
structure constraints such as matroid, totally unimodular, or knapsack
constraints, which dub as model-based sparsity. We construct the dense
measurement matrix using a probabilistic method so that it satisfies the
so-called restricted isometry property in the $\ell_2$-norm. While recovery
using such matrices is measurement-optimal as they require the smallest sketch
sizes $\numsam= O(\sparsity \log(\dimension/\sparsity))$, the existing
algorithms require superlinear runtime $\Omega(N\log(N/K))$ with the exception
of Porat and Strauss, which requires $O(\beta^5\epsilon^{-3}K(N/K)^{1/\beta}),

bounded perturbations in $u$ as well as perturbations on $\bestsignal$ itself.

stable at least as long as the concentration of vacancies is below 2.5%. In the

in the crystalline lattice and are strongly correlated with an attractive

disappear and in their place one finds dislocations and a revival of the

well as optimistic techniques based on conditional synchronization primitives

leverage the concurrency inherent to multi-cores.
  In this paper, we compare the level of concurrency one can obtain by
converting a sequential program into a concurrent one using optimistic or
pessimistic techniques. To establish fair comparison of such implementations,
we introduce a new correctness criterion for concurrent programs, defined
independently of the synchronization techniques they use.
  We treat a program's concurrency as its ability to accept a concurrent
schedule, a metric inspired by the theories of both databases and transactional
memory. We show that pessimistic locking can provide strictly higher
concurrency than transactions for some applications whereas transactions can
provide strictly higher concurrency than pessimistic locks for others. Finally,
we show that combining the benefits of the two synchronization techniques can
provide strictly more concurrency than any of them individually. We propose a
list-based set algorithm that is optimal in the sense that it accepts all
correct concurrent schedules. As we show via experimentation, the optimality in
terms of concurrency is reflected by scalability gains.

near-edge structure (XANES) and related theoretical developments, we present
the Al K-edge XANES spectra of corundum and beryl for temperature ranging from
300K to 930K. These experimental results provide a first evidence of the role
of thermal fluctuation in XANES at the Al K-edge especially in the pre-edge
region. The study is carried out by polarized XANES measurements of single
crystals. For any orientation of the sample with respect to the x-ray beam, the
pre-edge peak grows and shifts to lower energy with temperature. In addition
temperature induces modifications in the position and intensities of the main
XANES features. First-principles DFT calculations are performed for both
compounds. They show that the pre-edge peak originates from forbidden 1s to 3s
transitions induced by vibrations. Three existing theoretical models are used
to take vibrations into account in the absorption cross section calculations:
i) an average of the XANES spectra over the thermal displacements of the
absorbing atom around its equilibrium position, ii) a method based on the crude
Born-Oppenheimer approximation where only the initial state is averaged over
thermal displacements, iii) a convolution of the spectra obtained for the atoms
at the equilibrium positions with an approximate phonon spectral function. The
theoretical spectra so obtained permit to qualitatively understand the origin
of the spectral modifications induced by temperature. However the correct
treatment of thermal fluctuation in XANES spectroscopy requires more
sophisticated theoretical tools.

magnitude of its Fourier transform, also known as phase retrieval. The problem
arises in many areas of astronomy, crystallography, optics, and coherent
diffraction imaging (CDI). Our main goal is to develop an efficient
reconstruction method based on continuous optimization techniques. Unlike
current reconstruction methods, which are based on alternating projections, our
approach leads to a much faster and more robust method. However, all previous
attempts to employ continuous optimization methods, such as Newton-type
algorithms, to the phase retrieval problem failed. In this work we provide an
explanation for this failure, and based on this explanation we devise a
sufficient condition that allows development of new reconstruction
methods---approximately known Fourier phase. We demonstrate that a rough (up to
$\pi/2$ radians) Fourier phase estimate practically guarantees successful
reconstruction by any reasonable method. We also present a new reconstruction
method whose reconstruction time is orders of magnitude faster than that of the
current method-of-choice in phase retrieval---Hybrid Input-Output (HIO).
Moreover, our method is capable of successful reconstruction even in the
situations where HIO is known to fail. We also extended our method to other
applications: Fourier domain holography, and interferometry. Additionally we
developed a new sparsity-based method for sub-wavelength CDI. Using this method
we demonstrated experimental resolution exceeding several times the physical
limit imposed by the diffraction light properties (so called diffraction
limit).

increasing packing fraction ({\phi} \geq 0.56), where nucleation is more

ferromagnetic Heisenberg chain and on fractal lattices by means of the
decimation renormalization-group (RG) method. It is found that the entanglement
decreases with increasing temperature and it disappears beyond a critical value
T_{c}. Thermal entanglement at a certain temperature first increases with the
increase of the anisotropy parameter {\Delta} and then decreases sharply to
zero when {\Delta} is close to the isotropic point. We also show how the
entanglement evolves as the size of the system L becomes large via the RG
method. As L increases, for the spin chain and Koch curve the entanglement
between two terminal spins is fragile and vanishes when L\geq17, but for two
kinds of diamond-type hierarchical (DH) lattices the entanglement is rather
robust and can exist even when L becomes very large. Our result indicates that
the special fractal structure can affect the change of entanglement with system
size.

These relations follow different trends at the low- and the high-mass ends. The
processes driving the curvature of scaling relations remain uncertain. In this
letter, we focus on the specific family of early-type galaxies, deriving the
star formation histories of a complete sample of visually classified galaxies
from SDSS-DR7 over the redshift range 0.01<z<0.025, covering a stellar mass
interval from 10^9 to 3 x 10^11 Msun. Our sample features the characteristic
""knee"" in the surface brightness vs. mass distribution at Mstar~3 x 10^10 Msun.
We find a clear difference between the age and metallicity distributions of the
stellar populations above and beyond this knee, which suggests a sudden
transition from a constant, highly efficient mode of star formation in
high-mass galaxies, gradually decreasing towards the low-mass end of the
sample. At fixed mass, our early-type sample is more efficient in building up
the stellar content at early times in comparison to the general population of
galaxies, with half of the stars already in place by redshift z~2 for all
masses. The metallicity-age trend in low-mass galaxies is not compatible with
infall of metal-poor gas, suggesting instead an outflow-driven relation.

cosmological constant in the presence of a minimally coupled massless scalar
field. The spacetimes have a $(d-2)$-dimensional base manifold given by an
Einstein space and the massless scalar field depends only on the radial
coordinate. The field equations are decoupled in the general case, and can be
solved exactly for the cases when either the cosmological constant vanishes or
the base manifold is Ricci flat. We focus on the case of a negative
cosmological constant and a Ricci-flat base manifold. The solution has a
curvature singularity located at the origin, where also the scalar field
diverges. Since there is no event horizon surrounding this singularity, the
solution describes a naked singularity dressed with a nontrivial scalar field.
This spacetime is an asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter one when the
Ricci-flat base manifold is locally flat. The asymptotic solution for an
arbitrary Einstein base manifold is found and the corresponding mass,
calculated through the canonical generator of the time-translation invariance,
is shown to be finite. The contribution to the mass from the scalar field at
infinity is also discussed.

non-commutative probability space. A k-divisible element is a (non-commutative)
random variable whose n-th moment vanishes whenever n is not a multiple of k.
First, we consider the combinatorial convolution \ast in the lattices NC of
non-crossing partitions and NC^k of k-divisible non-crossing partitions and
show that convolving k times with the zeta-function in NC is equivalent to
convolving once with the zeta-function in NC^k. Furthermore, when x is
k-divisible, we derive a formula for the free cumulants of x^k in terms of the
free cumulants of x, involving k-divisible non-crossing partitions. Second, we
prove that if a and s are free and s is k-divisible then sps and a are free,
whenever p is any polynomial (on a and s) of degree k - 2 on s. Moreover, we
define a notion of R-diagonal k-tuples and prove similar results. Next, we show
that free multiplicative convolution between a measure concentrated in the
positive real line and a probability measure with k-symmetry is well defined.
Analytic tools to calculate this convolution are developed. Finally, we
concentrate on free additive powers of k-symmetric distributions and prove that
\mu t is a well defined probability measure, for all t > 1. We derive central
limit theorems and Poisson type ones. More generally, we consider freely
infinitely divisible measures and prove that free infinite divisibility is
maintained under the mapping \mu \rightarrow \mu^k . We conclude by focusing on
(k-symmetric) free stable distributions, for which we prove a reproducing
property generalizing the ones known for one sided and real symmetric free
stable laws.

all light-quark states with baryon number zero listed in the 2011 edition of

linear regression, with weight of each resonance inversely proportional to its
half-width squared, $(\Gamma/2)^2$. That way we are side-stepping possible
channel-dependent and model-dependent extractions of the resonance parameters
and are able to undertake an error analysis. The method complies to the fact
that the pole position of the resonance is typically shifted from
channel-dependent extractions by $\sim\Gamma/2$. This is also a feature of the
large-$N_c$ limit of QCD, where the masses change by $ \Gamma/2$ when evolving
from $N_c=3$ to $N_c=\infty$. Our value for the slope of the radial Regge
trajectories is $a=1.35(4) GeV^2$. We discuss the fundamental issue whether the
masses of the light-quark non-strange states fit into a universal pattern
$M_{nJ}^2 = a(n+J) +b$, as suggested by Afonin, and also predicted by some
holographic models. Our joint linear-regression analysis in the $(n,J,M^2)$
Regge planes indicates, at a statistically significant level of 4.5 standard
deviations, that the slopes of the radial Regge trajectories are larger from
the angular-momentum slopes. Thus no strict universality of slopes occurs in
the light non-strange meson spectra.

be striking: the photon number distribution gets localized and it peaks
maximally for a particular value of squeezing. The atomic inversion retains its
structure for a longer time. The mean linear entropy shows that the atom has a
tendency to get disentangled from field within the collapse region and also in
the revival region, for mild squeezing. These properties are absent for the

elucidate a connection between these properties and the photon statistics of

hidden gauge formalism for the interaction of vector mesons, then review
results for vector baryon interaction and in particular the resonances which
appear as composite states, dynamically generated from the interaction of
vector mesons with baryons. New developments concerning the mixing of these
states with pseudoscalars and baryons are also reported. We include some
discussion on the $5/2^+$ $\Delta$ resonances around 2000 MeV, where we suggest
that the $\Delta(2000)5/2^+$ resonance, which comes in the PDG from averaging a
set of resonances appearing around 1700 MeV and another one around 2200 MeV,
corresponds indeed to two distinct resonances. We also report on a hidden charm
baryon state around 4400 MeV coming from the interaction of vector mesons and
baryons with charm, and how this state has some repercussion in the $J/\psi$
suppression in nuclei. The interaction of $K^*$ in nuclei is also reported and
suggestions are made to measure by means of the transparency ratio the huge
width in the medium that the theoretical calculations predict. The formalism is
extended to $J/\psi$ interaction with nuclei and the transparency ratio for
$J/\psi$ photoproduction in nuclei is studied and shown to be a good tool to
find possible baryon states which couple to $J/\psi N$.

theory of time, space and velocity, predicts the existence of an acceleration
a_0 = c / tau due to the expansion of the universe, where c is the speed of
light in vacuum, tau = 1 / h is the Hubble-Carmeli time constant, where h is
the Hubble constant at zero distance and no gravity.
  The Carmeli force on a particle of mass m is F_c = m a_0, a fifth force in
nature.
  In CGR, the effective mass density rho_eff = rho - rho_c, where rho is the
matter density and rho_c is the critical mass density which we identify with
the vacuum mass density rho_vac = -rho_c.
  The fields resulting from the weak field solution of the Einstein field
equations in 5-D CGR and the Carmeli force are used to hypothesize the
production of a pair of particles.
  The mass of each particle is found to be m = tau c^3 / 4 G, where G is
Newton's constant.
  The vacuum mass density derived from the physics is rho_vac = -rho_c = -3 /
(8 pi G tau^2).
  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) black body radiation at the temperature
T_o = 2.72548 K which fills that volume is found to have a relationship to the
ionization energy of the Hydrogen atom. Define the radiation energy
epsilon_gamma = (1 - g) m c^2 / N_gamma, where (1-g) is the fraction of the
initial energy m c^2 which converts to photons, g is a function of the baryon
density parameter Omega_b and N_gamma is the total number of photons in the CMB
radiation field. We make the connection with the ionization energy of the first
quantum level of the Hydrogen atom by the hypothesis epsilon_gamma = [(1 - g) m

different perspective and pay attention to problems that have been posed in
previous studies on the subject. We show results which provide extra
experimental evidence on the existence of two $\Lambda(1405)$ states. We then
show the findings of a recent approach to Faddeev equations using chiral
unitary dynamics, where an explicit cancellation of the two body off shell
amplitude with three body forces stemming from the same chiral Lagrangians
takes place. This removal of the unphysical off shell part of the amplitudes is
most welcome and renders the approach unambiguous, showing that only on shell
two body amplitudes need to be used. With this information in mind we use an
approximation to the Faddeev equations within the fixed center approximation to
study the $\bar{K}NN$ system, providing answers within this approximation to
questions that have been brought before and evaluating binding energies and
widths of this three body system. As a novelty with respect to recent work on
the topic we find a bound state of the system with spin S=1, like a bound state
of $\bar{K}$-deuteron, less bound that the one of S=0, where all recent efforts
have been devoted. The width is relatively large in this case, suggesting
problems in a possible experimental observation.

single-cell genomes, and metagenomes has enabled investigation of a wide range
of organisms and ecosystems. However, sampling variation in short-read data
sets and high sequencing error rates of modern sequencers present many new
computational challenges in data interpretation. These challenges have led to
the development of new classes of mapping tools and {\em de novo} assemblers.
These algorithms are challenged by the continued improvement in sequencing
throughput. We here describe digital normalization, a single-pass computational
algorithm that systematizes coverage in shotgun sequencing data sets, thereby
decreasing sampling variation, discarding redundant data, and removing the
majority of errors. Digital normalization substantially reduces the size of
shotgun data sets and decreases the memory and time requirements for {\em de
novo} sequence assembly, all without significantly impacting content of the
generated contigs. We apply digital normalization to the assembly of microbial
genomic data, amplified single-cell genomic data, and transcriptomic data. Our
implementation is freely available for use and modification.

3.51$\pm$0.4 h in the EPIC data and at 4.0$\pm$0.8 h in the OM data. The X-ray
spectrum is consistent with the emission from an absorbed thin thermal plasma
with a temperature distribution given by an isobaric cooling flow. The maximum
temperature of the cooling flow model is $kT_{max}=43_{-12}^{+23}$ keV. Such a
high temperature can be reached in a shocked region and, given the periodicity
detected, most likely arises in a magnetically-channelled accretion flow
characteristic of intermediate polars. The pulsed fraction of the 3.51 h
modulation decreases with energy as observed in the X-ray light curves of
magnetic CVs, possibly due either to occultation of the accretion column by the
white dwarf body or phase-dependent to absorption. We do not find the 57 s
white dwarf spin period, with a pulse amplitude of 4 mmag, reported by Woudt et
al. (2009) either in the Optical Monitor (OM) data, which are sensitive to

  Columns, and Preconditioned Least Squares Problems","Under revision for SIMAX. Matlab code can be downloaded from
  http://www4.ncsu.edu/~tawentwo/kappaSQ_upToDate.zip",,,,math.NA,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Motivated by the least squares solver Blendenpik, we investigate three
strategies for uniform sampling of rows from m x n matrices Q with orthonormal
columns. The goal is to determine, with high probability, how many rows are
required so that the sampled matrices have full rank and are well-conditioned
with respect to inversion.
  Extensive numerical experiments illustrate that the three sampling strategies
(without replacement, with replacement, and Bernoulli sampling) behave almost
identically, for small to moderate amounts of sampling. In particular, sampled
matrices of full rank tend to have two-norm condition numbers of at most 10.
  We derive a bound on the condition number of the sampled matrices in terms of
the coherence {\mu} of Q. This bound applies to all three different sampling
strategies; it implies a, not necessarily tight, lower bound of O(m {\mu}
ln(n)) for the number of sampled rows; and it is realistic and informative even
for matrices of small dimension and the stringent requirement of a 99 percent
success probability.
  For uniform sampling with replacement we derive a potentially tighter
condition number bound in terms of the leverage scores of Q. To obtain a more
easily computable version of this bound, in terms of just the largest leverage
scores, we first derive a general bound on the two-norm of diagonally scaled
matrices.
  To facilitate the numerical experiments and test the tightness of the bounds,
we present algorithms to generate matrices with user-specified coherence and
leverage scores. These algorithms, the three sampling strategies, and a large
variety of condition number bounds are implemented in the Matlab toolbox
kappa_SQ_v3.

noisy or delayed fashion. The problem considered in this paper is to estimate
the first time \tau the random walk reaches a given level. Specifically, the
p-moment (p\geq 1) optimization problem \inf_\eta \ex|\eta-\tau|^p is
investigated where the infimum is taken over the set of stopping times that are
defined on the observation process.
  When there is no drift, optimal stopping rules are characterized for both
types of observations. When there is a drift, upper and lower bounds on
\inf_\eta \ex|\eta-\tau|^p are established for both types of observations. The
bounds are tight in the large-level regime for noisy observations and in the
large-level-large-delay regime for delayed observations. Noteworthy, for noisy
observations there exists an asymptotically optimal stopping rule that is a
function of a single observation.
  Simulation results are provided that corroborate the validity of the results
for non-asymptotic settings.

formation takes place preferentially at high metallicity. In the core accretion
model of planet formation this is expected because heavy elements are needed to
form the dust grains which settle into the midplane of the protoplanetary disk
and coagulate to form the planetesimals from which planetary cores are
assembled. As well, there is observational evidence that the lifetimes of
circumstellar disks are shorter at lower metallicities, likely due to greater
susceptibility to photoevaporation. Here we estimate the minimum metallicity
for planet formation, by comparing the timescale for dust grain growth and
settling to that for disk photoevaporation. For a wide range of circumstellar
disk models and dust grain properties, we find that the critical metallicity
above which planets can form is a function of the distance r at which the
planet orbits its host star. With the iron abundance relative to that of the
Sun [Fe/H] as a proxy for the metallicity, we estimate a lower limit for the
critical abundance for planet formation of [Fe/H]_crit ~ -1.5 + log(r/1 AU),
where an astronomical unit (AU) is the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
This prediction is in agreement with the available observational data, and
carries implications for the properties of the first planets and for the
emergence of life in the early Universe. In particular, it implies that the
first Earth-like planets likely formed from circumstellar disks with
metallicities Z > 0.1 Z_Sun. If planets are found to orbit stars with
metallicities below the critical metallicity, this may be a strong challenge to
the core accretion model.

conducting portion serves as a natural lead that can be used to probe these
Majorana modes via tunneling. The enhanced role of interactions in one

superconductor-Luttinger liquid junction. We investigate such junctions between
both helical and spinful Luttinger liquids, and topological as well as
non-topological superconductors. We determine the phase diagram for each case

fixed points describing either perfect normal reflection or perfect Andreev
reflection. In addition to capturing (in some instances) the familiar
Majorana-mediated `zero-bias anomaly' in a new framework, we show that
interactions yield dramatic consequences in certain regimes. Indeed, we
establish that strong repulsion removes this conductance anomaly altogether
while strong attraction produces dynamically generated effective Majorana modes
even in a junction with a trivial superconductor. Interactions further lead to
striking signatures in the local density of states and the line-shape of the
conductance peak at finite voltage, and also are essential for establishing
smoking-gun transport signatures of Majorana fermions in spinful Luttinger
liquid junctions.

mass 5 - 10 times heavier than the squark masses is automatic and technically
natural, in stark contrast to supersymmetric models with Majorana gaugino
masses. At the LHC, colored sparticle production is suppressed not only by the
absence of gluino pair (or associated) production, but also because several of
the largest squark pair production channels are suppressed or absent. We recast
the null results from the present jets plus missing energy searches at LHC for
supersymmetry onto a supersoft supersymmetric simplified model (SSSM). Assuming

the spectral operator. Furthermore, we also give a necessary and sufficient
condition for the invertibility of the spectral operator (in the critical

operator is invertible (or equivalently, that zero does not belong to its
spectrum) if and only if the Riemann zeta function zeta(s) does not have any
zeroes on the vertical line Re(s)=c. Hence, it is not invertible in the
mid-fractal case when c=1/2, and it is invertible everywhere else (i.e., for
all c in(0,1) with c not equal to 1/2) if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is
true. We also show the existence of four types of (mathematical) phase

by an embedded giant planet. In this thesis, I discuss the stability of such
systems and explore the consequence of instability on planetary migration. I
begin with non-self-gravitating, low viscosity discs and show that giant
planets induce shocks inside its co-orbital region, leading to a profile
unstable to vortex formation around a potential vorticity minimum. This
instability is commonly known as the vortex or Rossby wave instability.
Vortex-planet interaction lead to episodic phases of migration, which can be
understood in the framework of type III migration. I then examine the effect of
disc self-gravity on gap stability. The linear theory of the Rossby wave
instability is extended to include disc gravity, which shows that self-gravity
is effective at stabilising the vortex instability at small azimuthal
wavenumber. This is consistent with the observation that more vortices develop
with increasing disc mass in hydrodynamic simulations. Vortices in
self-gravitating discs also resist merging, and is most simply understood as
pair-vortices undergoing mutual horsehoe turns upon encounter. I show that in
sufficiently massive discs vortex modes are suppressed. Instead, global spiral
instabilities develop which are associated with a potential vorticity maximum
at the gap edge. These edge modes can be physically understood as a result of
unstable interaction between the gap edge and the exterior disc through
gravity. I show the spiral arms can provide a positive torque on the planet,
leading to fast migration outwards. I confirm the above results, obtained from
razor-thin disc models, persist in three-dimensions.

SN Ia spectroscopic diversity. We study the spectroscopic and photometric
properties of SN Ia as a function of spectroscopic class using the
classification schemes of Branch et al. and Wang et al. The width-luminosity
relation appears to be steeper for SN Ia with broader lines. Based on the
evolution of the characteristic Si II 6355 line, we propose improved methods
for measuring velocity gradients, revealing a larger range than previously
suspected, from ~0 to ~400 km/s/day considering the instantaneous velocity
decline rate at maximum light. We find a weaker and less significant
correlation between Si II velocity and intrinsic B-V color at maximum light
than reported by Foley et al., owing to a more comprehensive treatment of
uncertainties and host galaxy dust. We study the extent of nuclear burning and
report new detections of C II 6580 in 23 early-time spectra. The frequency of C
II detections is not higher in SN Ia with bluer colors or narrower light
curves, in conflict with the recent results of Thomas et al. Based on nebular
spectra of 27 SN Ia, we find no relation between the FWHM of the iron emission
feature at ~4700 A and Dm15(B) after removing the two low-luminosity SN 1986G
and SN 1991bg, suggesting that the peak luminosity is not strongly dependent on
the kinetic energy of the explosion for most SN Ia. Finally, we confirm the
correlation of velocity shifts in some nebular lines with the intrinsic B-V
color of SN Ia at maximum light, although several outliers suggest a possible
non-monotonic behavior for the largest blueshifts.

Therefore, it is an important test case for Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) models,
which may bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of these
objects. Here, we explore how available and expected future observations of SN
2011fe can be used to constrain SN Ia explosion scenarios. We base our
discussion on three-dimensional simulations of a delayed detonation in a
Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf and of a violent merger of two white
dwarfs-realizations of explosion models appropriate for two of the most
widely-discussed progenitor channels that may give rise to SNe Ia. Although
both models have their shortcomings in reproducing details of the early and
near-maximum spectra of SN 2011fe obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory
(SNfactory), the overall match with the observations is reasonable. The level
of agreement is slightly better for the merger, in particular around maximum,
but a clear preference for one model over the other is still not justified.
Observations at late epochs, however, hold promise for discriminating the
explosion scenarios in a straightforward way, as a nucleosynthesis effect leads
to differences in the 55Co production. SN 2011fe is close enough to be followed
sufficiently long to study this effect.

limitations of BP and E-BP for 802.11-based wireless networks. SRCR solely
utilizes link qualities, while BP relies on queue differential to route
packets. CDP and E-BP rely on distance metrics which take into account queue
backlogs and link qualities in the network. E-BP computes its metric by summing
the ETX and queue differential, while CDP determines its metric by calculating
the least draining time to the destination. Our small testbed consisting of
twelve 802.11g nodes enables us to empirically compare the performance of
congestion-aware routing protocols (BP, E-BP and CDP) against benchmark SRCR.
For medium to high load UDP traffic, we observe that CDP exhibits significant
improvement with respect to both end-end delay and throughput over other
protocols with no loss of performance for TCP traffic. Backpressure-based
routing algorithms (BP and E-BP) show poorer performance for UDP and TCP
traffic. Finally, we carefully study the effects of the modular approach to
congestion-aware routing design in which the MAC layer is left intact

Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The main experiment on-board LISA
Pathfinder is the so-called LISA Technology Package (LTP) which has the aim to
measure the differential acceleration between two free-falling test masses with
an accuracy of 3x10^(-14) ms^(-2)/sqrt[Hz] between 1 mHz and 30 mHz. This
measurement is performed interferometrically by the Optical Metrology System
(OMS) on-board LISA Pathfinder. In this paper we present the development of an
experimental end-to-end testbed of the entire OMS. It includes the
interferometer and its sub-units, the interferometer back-end which is a
phasemeter and the processing of the phasemeter output data. Furthermore,
3-axes piezo actuated mirrors are used instead of the free-falling test masses
for the characterisation of the dynamic behaviour of the system and some parts
of the Drag-free and Attitude Control System (DFACS) which controls the test
masses and the satellite. The end-to-end testbed includes all parts of the LTP
that can reasonably be tested on earth without free-falling test masses. At its
present status it consists mainly of breadboard components. Some of those have
already been replaced by Engineering Models of the LTP experiment. In the next
steps, further Engineering Models and Flight Models will also be inserted in
this testbed and tested against well characterised breadboard components. The
presented testbed is an important reference for the unit tests and can also be
used for validation of the on-board experiment during the mission.

groups of galaxies and present results of the identification of galaxy groups

methodology follows an approach that resembles the standard friends-of-friends
(FoF) method. However, it uses assumptions on the mass of the dark matter halo
hosting a group of galaxies to link galaxies in the group using a local linking
length. Our method does not assumes any ad-hoc parameter for the identification
of groups, nor a linking length or a density threshold. This parameter-free
nature of the method, and the robustness of its results, are the most important
points of our work. We describe the data used for our study and give details of
the implementation of the method. We obtain galaxy groups and halo catalogs for
four volume limited samples whose properties are in good agreement with
previous works. They reproduces the expected stellar mass functions and follow
the expected stellar-halo mass relation. We found that most of the stellar
content in groups of galaxies comes from objects with $M_r$ absolute magnitudes
larger than -19, meaning that it is important to resolve the low luminosity
components of groups of galaxies to acquire detailed information about their
properties.

is written in terms of the minima or stationary points (collectively called
solutions) of a gauge-fixing functional. Due to the non-linearity of this
functional, it usually has many solutions called Gribov copies. The dependence
of the number of Gribov copies, n[U] on the different gauge orbits plays an
important role in constructing the Faddeev-Popov procedure and hence in
realising the BRST symmetry on the lattice. Here, we initiate a study of
counting n[U] for different orbits using three complimentary methods: 1.
analytical results in lower dimensions, and some lower bounds on n[U] in higher
dimensions, 2. the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation method, which
numerically finds all Gribov copies for a given orbit for small lattices, and
3. numerical minimisation (""brute force""), which finds many distinct Gribov
copies, but not necessarily all. Because n for the coset SU(N_c)/U(1) of an
SU(N_c) theory is orbit-independent, we concentrate on the residual compact
U(1) case in this article and establish that n is orbit-dependent for the
minimal lattice Landau gauge and orbit-independent for the absolute lattice
Landau gauge. We also observe that contrary to a previous claim, n is not
exponentially suppressed for the recently proposed stereographic lattice Landau
gauge compared to the naive gauge in more than one dimension.

matter (ADM) almost certainly require that the DM be part of a richer hidden
sector of interacting states of comparable mass or lighter. A general requisite
of models of ADM is that the vast majority of the symmetric component of the DM
number density must be removed in order to explain the observed relationship
$\Omega_B\sim\Omega_{DM}$ via the DM asymmetry. Demanding the efficient
annihilation of the symmetric component leads to a tension with experimental
limits if the annihilation is directly to Standard Model (SM) degrees of
freedom. A comprehensive effective operator analysis of the model independent
constraints on ADM from direct detection experiments and LHC monojet searches
is presented. Notably, the limits obtained essentially exclude models of ADM
with mass 1GeV$\lesssim m_{DM} \lesssim$ 100GeV annihilating to SM quarks via
heavy mediator states. This motivates the study of portal interactions between
the dark and SM sectors mediated by light states. Resonances and threshold
effects involving the new light states are shown to be important for
determining the exclusion limits.

individual power constraints. In the first part, a unicast scenario is
considered. The problem of finding the maximum achievable rate is formulated as
an optimization problem. Rather than solving this non-concave maximization
problem, we derive upper and lower bounds for the optimal rate. A cut-set like
upper bound is obtained in a closed form for a layered relay network. A
pseudo-optimal AF scheme is developed for a two-hop parallel network, which is
different from the conventional scheme with all amplification gains chosen as
the maximum possible values. The conditions under which either the novel scheme
or the conventional one achieves a rate within half a bit of the upper bound
are found. Then we provide an AF-based multi-hop ANC scheme with the two
schemes for a layered relay network. It is demonstrated that the lower bound of
the optimal rate can asymptotically achieve the upper bound when the network is
in the generalized high-SNR regime. In the second part, the optimal rate region
for a two-hop multiple access channel (MAC) via AF relays is investigated. In a
similar manner, we first derive an outer bound for it and then focus on
designing low complexity AF-based ANC schemes for different scenarios. Several
examples are given and the numerical results indicate that the achievable rate
region of the ANC schemes can perform close to the outer bound.

decoupling the quantization error from the measurement noise, the quantization
error is modeled as a random variable and estimated jointly with the signal

results in superior performance of the algorithm which is demonstrated by
extensive simulations in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for both

Kendall's tau and derive its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis
of no change by means a new U-statistic invariance principle for dependent
processes. The asymptotic distribution depends on the long run variance of
Kendall's tau, for which we propose an estimator and show its consistency.
Furthermore, assuming a single change-point, we show that the location of the
change-point is consistently estimated. Kendall's tau possesses a high
efficiency at the normal distribution, as compared to the normal maximum
likelihood estimator, Pearson's moment correlation coefficient. Contrary to
Pearson's correlation coefficient, it has excellent robustness properties and
shows no loss in efficiency at heavy-tailed distributions. We assume the data
$((X_i,Y_i))_{i=1,...,n}$ to be stationary and P-near epoch dependent on an
absolutely regular process. The P-near epoch dependence condition constitutes a
generalization of the usually considered $L_p$-near epoch dependence, $p \ge
1$, that does not require the existence of any moments. It is therefore very
well suited for our objective to efficiently detect changes in correlation for
arbitrarily heavy-tailed data.

data-hiding for security in camera surveillance. While most previous approaches
have focused on completely encrypting the video stream, we introduce a spatial
encryption scheme by blurring the image/video contents to create a CBP. Our
goal is to obscure detail in public video streams by blurring while allowing
behavior to be recognized and to quickly deblur the stream so that details are
available if behavior is recognized as suspicious. We create a CBP by blurring
the same latent image with two unknown kernels. The two kernels are coprime
when mapped to bivariate polynomials in the z domain. To deblur the CBP we
first use the coprime constraint to approximate the kernels and sample the
bivariate CBP polynomials in one dimension on the unit circle. At each sample
point, we factor the 1D polynomial pair and compose the results into a 2D
kernel matrix. Finally, we compute the inverse Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of
the kernel matrices to recover the coprime kernels and then the latent video
stream. It is therefore only possible to deblur the video stream if a user has
access to both streams. To improve the practicability of our algorithm, we
implement our algorithm using a graphics processing unit (GPU) to decrypt the
blurred video streams in real-time, and extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our new scheme can effectively protect sensitive identity
information in surveillance videos and faithfully reconstruct the unblurred
video stream when two blurred sequences are available.

distribution function involving both c-number variables (for the cavity mode)
and Grassmann variables (for the two level atom) can be used to treat the
Jaynes-Cummings model. Although it is a Grassmann function, the distribution
function is equivalent to six c-number functions of the two bosonic variables.
Experimental quantities are given as bosonic phase space integrals involving
the six functions. A Fokker-Planck equation involving both left and right
Grassmann differentiation can be obtained for the distribution function, and is
equivalent to six coupled equations for the six c-number functions.
  The approach used involves choosing the canonical form of the (non-unique)
positive P distribution function, where the correspondence rules for bosonic
operators are non-standard and hence the Fokker-Planck equation is also
unusual. Initial conditions, such as for initially uncorrelated states, are
used to determine the initial distribution function. Transformations to new
bosonic variables rotating at the cavity frequency enables the six coupled
equations for the new c-number functions (also equivalent to the canonical
Grassmann distribution function) to be solved analytically, based on an ansatz
from a 1980 paper by Stenholm. It is then shown that the distribution function
is the same as that determined from the well-known solution based on coupled
equations for state vector amplitudes of atomic and n-photon product states.
  The treatment of the simple two fermion mode Jaynes-Cummings model is a
useful test case for the future development of phase space Grassmann
distribution functional methods for multi-mode fermionic applications in

two-dimensional massive Dirac fermions is studied by the diagrammatic
technique. The quantum diffusion of massive Dirac fermions can be viewed as a
singlet Cooperon in the massless limit and a triplet Cooperon in the large-mass
limit. The spin-orbit scattering behaves like random magnetic fields only to
the triplet Cooperon, and suppresses the weak localization of Dirac fermions in
the large-mass regime. This behavior suggests an experiment to detect the weak
localization of bulk subbands in topological insulator thin films, in which a
narrowing of the cusp of the negative magnetoconductivity is expected after
doping heavy-element impurities. Finally, a detailed comparison between the
conventional two-dimensional electrons and Dirac fermions is presented for
impurities of orthogonal, symplectic, and unitary symmetries.

As joint user selection (US) and vector precoding (VP) (US-VP) with
zero-forcing transmit beamforming (ZF-BF), US and continuous VP (CVP) (US-CVP)
and data-dependent US (DD-US) are investigated. The replica method, developed
in statistical physics, is used to analyze the energy penalties for the two
US-VP schemes in the large-system limit, where the number of users, the number
of selected users, and the number of transmit antennas tend to infinity with
their ratios kept constant. Four observations are obtained in the large-system
limit: First, the assumptions of replica symmetry (RS) and 1-step replica
symmetry breaking (1RSB) for DD-US can provide acceptable approximations for
low and moderate system loads, respectively. Secondly, DD-US outperforms CVP
with random US in terms of the energy penalty for low-to-moderate system loads.
Thirdly, the asymptotic energy penalty of DD-US is indistinguishable from that
of US-CVP for low system loads. Finally, a greedy algorithm of DD-US proposed
in authors' previous work can achieve nearly optimal performance for
low-to-moderate system loads.

prover-verifier interactions under parallel repetition when quantum information
is allowed, and the verifier acts independently in them.
  We first consider the case in which a value is associated with each of the
possible outcomes of an interaction. We prove that it is not possible for the
prover to improve on the optimum average value per repetition by repeating the
protocol multiple times in parallel.
  We look then at games in which the outcomes are classified into two types,
winning outcomes and losing outcomes. We ask what is the optimal probability
for the prover of winning at least k times out of n parallel repetitions, given
that the optimal probability of winning when only one repetition is considered
is $p$. A reasonable conjecture for the answer would be \sum_{m \geq k} {n
\choose m} p^m (1-p)^{n-m}, as that is the answer when it is optimal for the
prover to act independently. This is known to be the correct answer when k=n,
and also in the classical case. It is also correct in some generalizations of
the classical case that we will discuss later. We will show how this cannot be
extended to all cases, presenting an example of an interaction with k=1,n=2 in
which p\approx 0.85, but it is possible to always win at least once. We will
then give some upper bounds on the optimal probability for the prover of
winning k times out of n parallel repetitions. These bounds are expressed as a
function of p.
  Finally, we will connect our results to the study of error reduction for
quantum interactive proofs using parallel repetition.

chemical formula as YMn2+dZn20-x-dMx, with M = In or Al, and have identified
the characteristic preferences with which the incorporated M and excess Mn
atoms occupy the three crystallographic sites for Zn atoms. The Mn atoms in the
pyrochlore lattice possess small magnetic moments that interact with each other
antiferromagnetically but exhibit no long-range order above 0.4 K, probably
owing to the geometrical frustration of the pyrochlore lattice. As a result,
the effective mass of the conduction electrons is considerably enhanced, as
observed in the related pyrochlore-lattice compounds (Y,Sc)Mn2 and LiV2O4.
However, the presence of excess Mn atoms with large localized magnetic moments
comparable to spin 5/2 tends to mask the inherent magnetism of the pyrochlore
Mn atoms. It is suggested that ""YMn2Zn18In2"" with neither excess Mn atoms nor

They are used for
detection and localization of change for the purpose of anomaly detection,
monitoring, or planning. Distance queries are particularly useful when data
sets such as measurements, snapshots of a system, content, traffic matrices,
and activity logs are collected repeatedly.
  Random sampling, which can be efficiently performed over streamed or
distributed data, is an important tool for scalable data analysis. The sample
constitutes an extremely flexible summary, which naturally supports domain
queries and scalable estimation of statistics, which can be specified after the
sample is generated. The effectiveness of a sample as a summary, however,
hinges on the estimators we have.
  We derive novel estimators for estimating $L_p$ distance from sampled data.
Our estimators apply with the most common weighted sampling schemes: Poisson
Probability Proportional to Size (PPS) and its fixed sample size variants. They
also apply when the samples of different data sets are independent or
coordinated. Our estimators are admissible (Pareto optimal in terms of
variance) and have compelling properties.
  We study the performance of our Manhattan and Euclidean distance ($p=1,2$)
estimators on diverse datasets, demonstrating scalability and accuracy even
when a small fraction of the data is sampled. Our work, for the first time,
facilitates effective distance estimation over sampled data.

measurements carried out during drainage experiment in a sand column. We show
that the apparent measurement of DV / DP for the dipoles can provide the SP
coefficient in these conditions. Two tests have been performed using existing
models for the SP coefficient and a third one using a new relation. The results
show that existing models of unsaturated SP coefficients C(Sw) provide poor
results in terms of SP magnitude and behaviour. We demonstrate that the
unsaturated SP coefficient can be until one order of magnitude larger than
Csat, its value at saturation. We finally prove that the SP coefficient follows
a non-monotonous behaviour with respect to water saturation. Key words:

short-length codewords that permits balancing the tradeoff between the bit
error rate floor and waterfall region by modifying a single real-valued
parameter. The proposed approach is based on combining convolutional coding
with a $q$-ary linear combination and unequal energy allocation, the latter
being controlled by the aforementioned parameter. EXIT charts are used to shed
light on the convergence characteristics of the associated iterative decoder,
which is described in terms of factor graphs. Simulation results show that the
proposed scheme is able to adjust its end-to-end error rate performance
efficiently and easily, on the contrary to previous approaches that require a
full code redesign when the error rate requirements of the application change.
Simulations also show that, at mid-range bit-error rates, there is a small
performance penalty with respect to the previous approaches. However, the EXIT
chart analysis and the simulation results suggest that for very low bit-error
rates the proposed system will exhibit lower error floors than previous
approaches.

selection methodology in the case of high-dimensional problems where the
response variable can be right censored. We focuse on new stable variable
selection methods based on bootstrap for two methodologies: the Cox
proportional hazard model and survival trees. As far as the Cox model is
concerned, we investigate the bootstrapping applied to two variable selection
techniques: the stepwise algorithm based on the AIC criterion and the
L1-penalization of Lasso. Regarding survival trees, we review two
methodologies: the bootstrap node-level stabilization and random survival
forests. We apply these different approaches to two real data sets. We compare
the methods on the prediction error rate based on the Harrell concordance index
and the relevance of the interpretation of the corresponding selected models.
The aim is to find a compromise between a good prediction performance and ease
to interpretation for clinicians. Results suggest that in the case of a small
number of individuals, a bootstrapping adapted to L1-penalization in the Cox
model or a bootstrap node-level stabilization in survival trees give a good
alternative to the random survival forest methodology, known to give the
smallest prediction error rate but difficult to interprete by
non-statisticians. In a clinical perspective, the complementarity between the
methods based on the Cox model and those based on survival trees would permit
to built reliable models easy to interprete by the clinician.

Cooper channel. In this paper we concentrate on the exchange interaction and
generalize the functional bosonization formalism developed earlier for the
charging energy. This turned out to be challenging as the effective bosonic
action is formulated in terms of a vector field and is non-abelian due to the
non-commutativity of the spin operators. Here we develop a geometric approach
which is particularly useful in the mesoscopic Stoner regime, i.e., when the
strong exchange interaction renders the system close the the Stoner
instability. We show that it is sufficient to sum over the adiabatic paths of
the bosonic vector field and, for these paths, the crucial role is played by
the Berry phase. Using these results we were able to calculate the magnetic
susceptibility of the dot. The latter, in close vicinity of the Stoner

of quasi-static speckles. Speckle noise originates from wavefront errors caused
by various independent sources, and it evolves on different timescales pending
to their nature. An understanding of quasi-static speckles originating from
instrumental errors is paramount for the search of faint stellar companions.
Instrumental speckles average to a fixed pattern, which can be calibrated to a
certain extent, but their temporal evolution ultimately limit this possibility.
This study focuses on the laboratory evidence and characterization of the
quasi-static pinned speckle phenomenon. Specifically, we examine the coherent
amplification of the static speckle contribution to the noise variance in the
scientific image, through its interaction with quasi-static speckles. The
analysis of a time series of adaptively corrected, coronagraphic images
recorded in the laboratory enables the characterization of the temporal
stability of the residual speckle pattern in both direct and differential
coronagraphic images. We estimate that spoiled and fast-evolving quasi-static
speckles present in the system at the angstrom/nanometer level are affecting
the stability of the static speckle noise in the final image after the
coronagraph. The temporal evolution of the quasi-static wavefront error
exhibits linear power law, which can be used in first order to model
quasi-static speckle evolution in high-contrast imaging instruments.

with each spectral line treated separately, but this is generally inadequate
for multiplets where J-state interference plays a significant role. Through
simultaneous observations of all the 3 lines of a Cr I triplet, combined with
realistic radiative transfer modeling of the data, we show that it is necessary
to include J-state interference consistently when modeling lines with partially
interacting fine structure components. Polarized line formation theory that
includes J-state interference effects together with partial frequency
redistribution for a two-term atom is used to model the observations.
Collisional frequency redistribution is also accounted for. We show that the
resonance polarization in the Cr I triplet is strongly affected by the partial
frequency redistribution effects in the line core and near wing peaks. The Cr I
triplet is quite sensitive to the temperature structure of the photospheric
layers. Our complete frequency redistribution calculations in semi-empirical
models of the solar atmosphere cannot reproduce the observed near wing
polarization or the cross-over of the Stokes Q/I line polarization about the
continuum polarization level that is due to the J-state interference. When
however partial frequency redistribution is included, a good fit to these
features can be achieved. Further, to obtain a good fit to the far wings, a
small temperature enhancement of the FALF model in the photospheric layers is
necessary.

temperature $T_N$ and internal magnetic field $\mu_0H_{\rm int}$ are gradually
reduced for $x<0.04$. However, at $x=0.04$, $T_N$ is abruptly suppressed to be
30 K along with a tiny $\mu_0H_{\rm int}$, which is distinct from the
continuous disappearance of the ordered phases in the Ba122 systems of

in spatial coincidence with the binary system Eta Carinae. Since modulation of
the observed gamma-ray flux on orbital time scales has not been reported so
far, an unambiguous identification was hitherto not possible. Particularly the
observations made by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) posed additional
questions regarding the actual emission scenario owing to the existence of two
energetically distinct components in the gamma-ray spectrum of this source,
best described by an exponentially cutoff power-law function (CPL) at energies
below 10 GeV and a power-law (PL) component dominant at higher energies. The
increased exposure in conjunction with the improved instrumental response
functions of the LAT now allow us to perform a more detailed investigation of
location, spectral shape, and flux time history of the observed gamma-ray
emission.
  For the first time, we are able to report a weak but regular flux decrease
over time. This can be understood and interpreted in a colliding-wind binary
scenario for orbital modulation of the gamma-ray emission. We find the spectral
shape of the gamma-ray signal in agreement with a single emitting particle
population in combination with significant absorption by gamma-gamma pair
production.
  Studying the correlation of the flux decrease with the orbital separation of
the binary components allows us to predict the behaviour up to the next
periastron passage in 2014.

March 2009 to the beginning of January 2011. The main goal of this experiment
was to test the reliability of the quantum layer over a long period of time in

the key between the three nodes of the network. This QKD-secure network was
used by end-users through an application layer.

  Aims. To find improved candidate lists for clusters and associations
represented among Hipparcos stars, to establish distances, and to cast light on
the Pleiades distance anomaly.
  Methods. We use a six dimensional fitting procedure to identify candidates,
and plot CMDs for 20 of the nearest groups. We calculate the mean parallax
distance for all groups.
  Results. We identify lists of candidates and calculated parallax distances
for 42 clusters and 45 associations represented within the Hipparcos catalogue.
We find agreement between parallax distance and photometric distances for the
most important clusters. For single stars in the Pleiades we find mean parallax
distance 125.6 \pm 4.2 pc and photometric distance 132 \pm 3 pc calibrated to
nearby groups of similar in age and composition. This gives no reason to doubt
either the Hipparcos database or stellar evolutionary theory.

selection is strongly influenced by the structure of the underlying fitness
landscape, which encodes the interactions between mutations at different
genetic loci. Theoretical studies of such landscapes have been carried out for
several decades, but only recently experimental fitness measurements
encompassing all possible combinations of small sets of mutations have become
available. The empirical studies have spawned new questions about the
accessibility of optimal genotypes under natural selection. Depending on
population dynamic parameters such as mutation rate and population size,
evolutionary accessibility can be quantified through the statistics of
accessible mutational pathways (along which fitness increases monotoncially),
or through the study of the basin of attraction of the optimal genotype under
greedy (steepest ascent) dynamics. Here we investigate these two measures of
accessibility in the framework of Kauffman's $LK$-model, a paradigmatic family
of random fitness landscapes with tunable ruggedness. The key parameter
governing the strength of genetic interactions is the number $K$ of interaction
partners of each of the $L$ sites in the genotype sequence. In general,
accessibility increases with increasing genotype dimensionality $L$ and
decreases with increasing number of interactions $K$. Remarkably, however, we
find that some measures of accessibility behave non-monotonically as a function
of $K$, indicating a special role of the most sparsely connected, non-trivial
cases K=1 and 2. The relation between models for fitness landscapes and spin
glasses is also addressed.

Moran type is our object of study. At each timestep, a pair of diploid
individuals drawn uniformly at random contribute offspring to the population.
The number of offspring can be large relative to the total population size.
Similar `heavily skewed' reproduction mechanisms have been considered by
various authors recently. Each diploid parental individual contributes exactly
one chromosome to each diploid offspring, and hence ancestral lineages can only
coalesce when in distinct individuals. A separation of timescales phenomenon is
thus observed. A result of M\""{o}hle (1998) is extended to obtain convergence
of the ancestral process to an ancestral recombination graph necessarily
admitting simultaneous multiple mergers of ancestral lineages. The usual
ancestral recombination graph is obtained as a special case of our model when
the parents contribute only one offspring to the population each time. Due to
diploidy and large offspring numbers, novel effects appear. For example, the
marginal genealogy at each locus admits simultaneous multiple mergers in up to
four groups, and different loci remain substantially correlated even as the
recombination rate grows large. Thus, genealogies for loci far apart on the
same chromosome remain correlated. Correlation in coalescence times for two
loci is derived and shown to be a function of the coalescence parameters of our
model. Extending the observations by Eldon and Wakeley (2008), predictions of
linkage disequilibrium are shown to be functions of the reproduction parameters
of our model, in addition to the recombination rate. Correlations in ratios of
coalescence times between loci can be high, even when the recombination rate is
high and sample size is large.

Saturn mass) open sufficiently deep gaps in the gas disc such that the density
maximum at the outer edge of the gap can very efficiently trap metre-sized
solid bodies. This allows the accumulation of solids at the outer edge of the
gap as solids from large radii spiral inwards to the trapping region. This
process of accumulation occurs fastest for those bodies that spiral inwards
most rapidly, typically metre-sized boulders, whilst smaller and larger objects
will not migrate sufficiently rapidly in the discs lifetime to benefit from the

material, as large as several Earth masses, may form, potentially collapsing
under self-gravity to form planets or planetesimals. These results are in
agreement with Lyra et al. (2009), supporting their finding that the formation

in tokamaks is considered. To obtain the complex dependences observed in

that redistributes the momentum within the tokamak in the absence of a
preexisting velocity. When the lowest order gyrokinetic formulation is used, a
symmetry of the model precludes this possibility, making small effects in the
gyroradius over scale length expansion necessary. These effects that are
usually small become important for momentum transport because the symmetry of
the lowest order gyrokinetic formulation leads to the cancellation of the
lowest order momentum flux. The accuracy to which the gyrokinetic equation
needs to be obtained to retain all the physically relevant effects is

generation number gets new contributions (which can be tuned suitably) and at
the same time the space of bundle moduli of the new, twisted bundle is a proper
subspace (where the 'new', non-generic twist class exists) of the original
bundle moduli space; one thus gets a model, closely related to the original
model one started with, but with enhanced flexibility in the generation number

reduced. Whereas in the previous paper the emphasis was on examples for the new
flexibility in the generation number we here classify and describe explicitly

  Expansion","160 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables",,,,math.CO,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Recently, a novel method based on coding partitions [1]-[4] has been used to
derive power series expansions to previously intractable problems. In this
method the coefficients at $k$ are determined by summing the contributions made
by each partition whose elements sum to $k$. These contributions are found by
assigning values to each element and multiplying by an appropriate multinomial
factor. This work presents a theoretical framework for the partition method for
a power series expansion. To overcome the complexity due to the contributions,
a programming methodology is created allowing more general problems to be
studied than envisaged originally. The methodology uses the bi-variate
recursive central partition (BRCP) algorithm, which is based on a tree-diagram
approach to scanning partitions. Its main advantage is that partitions are
generated in the multiplicity representation. During the development of the
theoretical framework, scanning over partitions was seen as a discrete
operation with an operator $L_{P,k}[ \cdot]$, whose summand depends on the
coefficients of the two series when the original function is written as a
pseudo-composite function. Simple modifications result in programs for other
operators of specific types of partitions such as: (1) only odd or even
elements, (2) a fixed number of elements, (3) discrete elements, (4) specific
elements and (5) those restricted by element size. Another modification
generates conjugate partitions by transposing Ferrers diagrams. The operator
approach is then applied to the generating functions for both discrete and
standard partitions. The main generalisation introduces a parameter $\omega$,
whose powers give the number of elements in the partitions while the
coefficients become polynomials in $\omega$. Finally, power series expansions
for more advanced infinite products are derived, culminating in Heine's
multi-parameter product.

outer parts of protostellar envelopes and dense inner regions of circumstellar
disks, and as gas in the envelopes close to the protostars, in the upper layers
of circumstellar disks and in regions of powerful outflows and shocks. In this
paper we probe the mechanism regulating the warm gas-phase water abundance in
the innermost hundred AU of deeply embedded (Class~0) low-mass protostars, and
investigate its chemical relationship to other molecular species during these
stages. Millimeter wavelength thermal emission from the para-H2-18O
3(1,3)-2(2,0) (Eu=203.7 K) line is imaged at high angular resolution (0.75"";
190 AU) with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer towards the deeply
embedded low-mass protostars NGC 1333-IRAS2A and NGC 1333-IRAS4A. Compact
H2-18O emission is detected towards IRAS2A and one of the components in the
IRAS4A binary; in addition CH3OCH3, C2H5CN, and SO2 are detected. Extended
water emission is seen towards IRAS2A, possibly associated with the outflow.
The detections in all systems suggests that the presence of water on <100 AU
scales is a common phenomenon in embedded protostars. We present a scenario in
which the origin of the emission from warm water is in a flattened disk-like
structure dominated by inward motions rather than rotation. The gas-phase water
abundance varies between the sources, but is generally much lower than a
canonical abundance of 10^-4, suggesting that most water (>96 %) is frozen out
on dust grains at these scales. The derived abundances of CH3OCH3 and SO2
relative to H2-18O are comparable for all sources pointing towards similar
chemical processes at work. In contrast, the C2H5CN abundance relative to
H2-18O is significantly lower in IRAS2A, which could be due to different
chemistry in the sources.

  to appear in Nature, April 2012",,10.1038/nature11031,,physics.geo-ph,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The Earth acts as a gigantic heat engine driven by decay of radiogenic
isotopes and slow cooling, which gives rise to plate tectonics, volcanoes, and
mountain building. Another key product is the geomagnetic field, generated in
the liquid iron core by a dynamo running on heat released by cooling and
freezing to grow the solid inner core, and on chemical convection due to light
elements expelled from the liquid on freezing. The power supplied to the
geodynamo, measured by the heat-flux across the core-mantle boundary (CMB),
places constraints on Earth's evolution. Estimates of CMB heat-flux depend on
properties of iron mixtures under the extreme pressure and temperature
conditions in the core, most critically on the thermal and electrical
conductivities. These quantities remain poorly known because of inherent
difficulties in experimentation and theory. Here we use density functional
theory to compute these conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core
conditions from first principles- the first directly computed values that do
not rely on estimates based on extrapolations. The mixtures of Fe, O, S, and Si
are taken from earlier work and fit the seismologically-determined core density
and inner-core boundary density jump. We find both conductivities to be 2-3
times higher than estimates in current use. The changes are so large that core
thermal histories and power requirements must be reassessed. New estimates of
adiabatic heat-flux give 15-16 TW at the CMB, higher than present estimates of
CMB heat-flux based on mantle convection; the top of the core must be thermally
stratified and any convection in the upper core driven by chemical convection
against the adverse thermal buoyancy or lateral variations in CMB heat flow.
Power for the geodynamo is greatly restricted and future models of mantle
evolution must incorporate a high CMB heat-flux and explain recent formation of
the inner core.

amplitude RM effect for WASP-16 (Teff = 5700 \pm 150K), suggesting that the
star is a slow rotator and thus of an advanced age, and obtain a projected
alignment angle of lambda = -4.2 degrees +11.0 -13.9. For WASP-25 (Teff =
5750\pm100K) we detect a projected spin-orbit angle of lambda = 14.6 degrees
\pm6.7. WASP-31 (Teff = 6300\pm100K) is found to be well-aligned, with a
projected spin-orbit angle of lambda = 2.8degrees \pm3.1. A circular orbit is
consistent with the data for all three systems, in agreement with their
respective discovery papers. We consider the results for these systems in the
context of the ensemble of RM measurements made to date. We find that whilst
WASP-16 fits the hypothesis of Winn et al. (2010) that 'cool' stars (Teff <
6250K) are preferentially aligned, WASP-31 has little impact on the proposed
trend. We bring the total distribution of the true spin-orbit alignment angle,
psi, up to date, noting that recent results have improved the agreement with
the theory of Fabrycky & Tremaine (2007) at mid-range angles. We also suggest a
new test for judging misalignment using the Bayesian Information Criterion,

Intriguingly they show magnetic fluctuations reminiscent of the superconducting
(SC) cuprates, including a 'resonance' and an 'hour-glass' shaped dispersion,
which provide an opportunity to new insight to the coupling between spin
fluctuations and superconductivity. Here we report inelastic neutron scattering
data on Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{0.7}$Se$_{0.3}$ using excess iron concentration to tune
between a SC ($y=0.02$) and a non-SC ($y=0.05$) ground states. We find
incommensurate spectra in both samples but discover that in the one that
becomes SC, a constriction towards a commensurate hourglass shape develop well
above $T_c$. Conversely a spin-gap and concomitant spectral weight shift happen
below $T_c$. Our results imply that the hourglass shaped dispersion is most
likely a pre-requisite for superconductivity, whereas the spin-gap and shift of
spectral weight are consequences of superconductivity. We explain this
observation by pointing out that an inwards dispersion towards the commensurate
wave-vector is needed for the opening of a spin gap to lower the magnetic
exchange energy and hence provide the necessary condensation energy for the SC

superb opportunity to follow the evolution of a supernova and its remnant in
unprecedented detail. Recently, far-infrared (far-IR) and sub-mm emission was
detected from the direction of SN1987A, which was interpreted as due to the
emission from dust, possibly freshly synthesized in the SN ejecta. To better
constrain the location and hence origin of the far-IR and sub-mm emission in
SN1987A, we have attempted to resolve the object in that part of the
electro-magnetic spectrum. We observed SN1987A during July-September 2011 with
the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX), at a wavelength of 350 micron with
the Submillimetre APEX Bolometer CAmera (SABOCA) and at 870 micron with the
Large APEX BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA). The 350-micron image has superior angular
resolution (8"") over that of the Herschel Space Observatory 350-micron image
(25""). The 870-micron observation (at 20"" resolution) is a repetition of a
similar observation made in 2007. In both images, at 350 and 870 micron,
emission is detected from SN1987A, and the source is unresolved. The flux
densities in the new (2011) measurements are consistent with those measured
before with Herschel at 350 micron (in 2010) and with APEX at 870 micron (in
2007). A higher dust temperature (approximately 33 K) and lower dust mass might
be possible than what was previously thought. The new measurements, at the
highest angular resolution achieved so far at far-IR and sub-mm wavelengths,
strengthen the constraints on the location of the emission, which is thought to
be close to the site of SN1987A and its circumstellar ring structures. These
measurements set the stage for upcoming observations at even higher angular
resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).

to the Moore loop space functor $\Omega': Top*\to Mon$ after we have localized
$Mon$ with respect to all homomorphisms whose underlying maps are homotopy
equivalences and $Top*$ with respect to all based maps which are (not
necessarily based) homotopy equivalences. It is well-known that this
localization of $Top*$ exists, and we show that the localization of $Mon$ is
the category of monoids and homotopy classes of homotopy homomorphisms. To make
this statement precise we have to modify the classical definition of a homotopy
homomorphism, and we discuss the necessary changes. The adjunction is induced
by an adjunction up to homotopy between the category of well-pointed monoids
and homotopy homomorphisms and the category of well-pointed spaces. This
adjunction is shown to lift to diagrams. As a consequence, the well-known
derived adjunction between the homotopy colimit and the constant diagram
functor can also be seen to be induced by an adjuction up to homotopy before
taking homotopy classes. As applications we among other things deduce a more
algebraic version of the group completion theorem and show that the classifying
space functor preserves homotopy colimits up to natural homotopy equivalences.

first-order linear stochastic systems. The problem is posed as a two-player
team problem with a partially nested information pattern. The two players are
given by an estimator and an event-trigger. The event-trigger has full state
information and decides, whether the estimator shall obtain the current state
information by transmitting it through a resource constrained channel. The
objective is to find an optimal trade-off between the mean squared estimation
error and the expected transmission rate. The proposed iterative algorithm
alternates between optimizing one player while fixing the other player. It is
shown that the solution of the algorithm converges to a linear predictor and a
symmetric threshold policy, if the densities of the initial state and the noise
variables are even and radially decreasing functions. The effectiveness of the
approach is illustrated on a numerical example. In case of a multimodal
distribution of the noise variables a significant performance improvement can
be achieved compared to a separate design that assumes a linear prediction and
a symmetric threshold policy.

interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way and external galaxies, mostly either
in diffuse interstellar clouds or in the warm, dense environments of newly
formed low-mass and high-mass stars, i.e, in the dense shells of compact and
ultracompact HII regions (UCHIIRs). Until today, most studies of interstellar
OH involved the molecule's radio wavelength hyperfine structure (hfs)
transitions. These lines are generally not in LTE and either masing or
over-cooling complicates their interpretation. In the past, observations of
transitions between different rotational levels of OH, which are at
far-infrared wavelengths, have suffered from limited spectral and angular
resolution. Since these lines have critical densities many orders of magnitude
higher than the radio wavelength ground state hfs lines and are emitted from
levels with more than 100 K above the ground state, when observed in emission,
they probe very dense and warm material. We probe the warm and dense molecular
material surrounding the UCHIIR/OH maser sources W3(OH), G10.62-0.39 and NGC
7538 IRS1 by studying the $^2\Pi_{{1/2}}, J = {3/2} - {1/2}$ rotational
transition of OH in emission and, toward the last source also the molecule's

lines, which are near 1.84 THz ($163 \mu$m) and 2.51 THz ($119.3 \mu$m). We
clearly detect the OH lines, some of which are blended with each other.

To appear: LiCS 2012,,10.1109/LICS.2012.35,,quant-ph cs.LO math.CT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Categorical quantum mechanics studies quantum theory in the framework of
dagger-compact closed categories.
  Using this framework, we establish a tight relationship between two key
quantum theoretical notions: non-locality and complementarity. In particular,
we establish a direct connection between Mermin-type non-locality scenarios,
which we generalise to an arbitrary number of parties, using systems of
arbitrary dimension, and performing arbitrary measurements, and a new stronger
notion of complementarity which we introduce here.
  Our derivation of the fact that strong complementarity is a necessary
condition for a Mermin scenario provides a crisp operational interpretation for
strong complementarity. We also provide a complete classification of strongly
complementary observables for quantum theory, something which has not yet been
achieved for ordinary complementarity.
  Since our main results are expressed in the (diagrammatic) language of
dagger-compact categories, they can be applied outside of quantum theory, in
any setting which supports the purely algebraic notion of strongly
complementary observables. We have therefore introduced a method for discussing
non-locality in a wide variety of models in addition to quantum theory.
  The diagrammatic calculus substantially simplifies (and sometimes even
trivialises) many of the derivations, and provides new insights. In particular,
the diagrammatic computation of correlations clearly shows how local
measurements interact to yield a global overall effect. In other words, we
depict non-locality.

observed $X=x$, instances arise in practice in which $\varphi$ is to be
accompanied by an assessment of its loss, $L(\theta,\varphi(x))$, which is
unobservable since $\theta$ is unknown. A common approach to this assessment is
to consider estimation of $L(\theta,\varphi(x))$ by an estimator $\delta$,
called a loss estimator. We present an expository development of loss
estimation with substantial emphasis on the setting where the distributional
context is normal and its extension to the case where the underlying
distribution is spherically symmetric. Our overview covers improved loss
estimators for least squares but primarily focuses on shrinkage estimators.
Bayes estimation is also considered and comparisons are made with unbiased

kinetic power (L_kin) are dominated by inverse Compton emission from
upscattered external photons. Using a sample with a broad range in orientation
angle, including radio galaxies and blazars, we find that very high power
sources (L_kin > 10^45.5 erg s^{-1}) show a significant increase in the ratio
of inverse Compton to synchrotron power (Compton dominance) with decreasing
orientation angle, as measured by the radio core dominance and confirmed by the
distribution of superluminal speeds. This increase is consistent with beaming
expectations for external Compton (EC) emission, but not for synchrotron self
Compton (SSC) emission. For the lowest power jets (L_kin < 10^43.5 erg s^{-1}),
no trend between Compton and radio core dominance is found, consistent with
SSC. Importantly, the EC trend is not seen for moderately high power flat
spectrum radio quasars with strong external photon fields. Coupled with the
evidence that jet power is linked to the jet speed (Kharb et al. 2010), this
finding suggests that external photon fields become the dominant source of seed
photons in the jet comoving frame only for the faster and therefore more
powerful jets.

generation (SG), Globular Clusters (GCs) evolution models based on the
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) scenario so far included only the yields
available for the massive AGB stars, while the possible role of super-AGB
ejecta was either extrapolated or not considered. In this work, we explore the
role of super-AGB ejecta using yields recently calculated by Ventura and
D'Antona. Models of clusters showing extended Na-O anticorrelations, like NGC
2808, indicate that a SG formation history similar to that outlined in our
previous work is required: formation of an Extreme population with very large
helium content from the pure ejecta of super-AGB stars, followed by formation
of an Intermediate population by dilution of stellar ejecta with pristine gas.
The very O-poor Na-rich Extreme stars can be accounted for once deep-mixing is
assumed in SG giants forming in a gas with helium abundance Y> 0.34, which
significantly reduces the atmospheric oxygen content, while preserving the
sodium abundance. On the other hand, for clusters showing a mild O-Na
anticorrelation, like M 4, the use of the new yields broadens the range of SG
formation routes leading to abundance patterns consistent with observations. It
is shown that models in which SG stars form only from super-AGB ejecta promptly
diluted with pristine gas can reproduce the observations. We discuss the
variety of small helium variations occurring in this model and its relevance
for the horizontal branch morphology. In some of these models the duration of
the SG formation episode can be as short as \sim10 Myr; the formation time of
the SG is thus compatible with the survival of a cooling flow in the GC,
previous to the explosion of the SG core collapse supernovae. We also explore
models with formation of multiple populations in individual bursts, each
lasting no longer than \sim10 Myr.

  Intended for a non-specialist audience",,,,gr-qc physics.hist-ph,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We discuss the emergence of time in quantum gravity, and ask whether time is
always ""something that flows""'. We first recall that this is indeed the case in
both relativity and quantum mechanics, although in very different manners: time
flows geometrically in relativity (i.e. as a flow of proper time in the four
dimensional space-time), time flows abstractly in quantum mechanics (i.e. as a
flow in the space of observables of the system). We then ask the same question
in quantum gravity, in the light of the thermal time hypothesis of Connes and
Rovelli. The latter proposes to answer the question of time in quantum gravity
(or at least one of its many aspects), by postulating that time is a state
dependent notion. This means that one is able to make a notion of
time-as-an-abstract-flow - that we call the thermal time - emerge from the
knowledge of both: 1) the algebra of observables of the physical system under
investigation, 2) a state of thermal equilibrium of this system. Formally, this
thermal time is similar to the abstract flow of time in quantum mechanics, but
we show in various examples that it may have a concrete implementation either
as a geometrical flow, or as a geometrical flow combined with a non-geometric
action. This indicates that in quantum gravity, time may well still be
""something that flows"" at some abstract algebraic level, but this does not
necessarily imply that time is always and only ""something that flows"" at the
geometric level.

of the cylinder has N sites. We use a family of link modules over the periodic
Temperley-Lieb algebra EPTL_N(\beta, \alpha) introduced by Martin and Saleur,
and Graham and Lehrer. These are labeled by the numbers of sites N and of
defects d, and extend the standard modules of the original Temperley-Lieb
algebra. Beside the defining parameters \beta=u^2+u^{-2} with u=e^{i\lambda/2}
(weight of contractible loops) and \alpha (weight of non-contractible loops),
this family also depends on a twist parameter v that keeps track of how the
defects wind around the cylinder. The transfer matrix T_N(\lambda, \nu) depends
on the anisotropy \nu and the spectral parameter \lambda that fixes the model.
(The thermodynamic limit of T_N is believed to describe a conformal field
theory of central charge c=1-6\lambda^2/(\pi(\lambda-\pi)).)
  The family of periodic XXZ Hamiltonians is extended to depend on this new

established. The Gram determinant for the natural bilinear form on these link

Indeed, it contains zero and all integers from a given positive one. One can
define a simple operation on a non-ordinary semigroup, which we call here the
ordinarization transform, by removing its smallest non-zero non-gap (the
multiplicity) and adding its largest gap (the Frobenius number). This gives
another numerical semigroup and by repeating this transform several times we
end up with an ordinary semigroup. The genus, that is, the number of gaps, is
kept constant in all the transforms.
  This procedure allows the construction of a tree for each given genus
containing all semigrpoups of that genus and rooted in the unique ordinary
semigroup of that genus. We study here the regularity of these trees and the
number of semigroups at each depth. For some depths it is proved that the
number of semigroups increases with the genus and it is conjectured that this
happens at all given depths. This may give some lights to a former conjecture
saying that the number of semigroups of a given genus increases with the genus.
  We finally give an identification between semigroups at a given depth in the

projective-superspace techniques developed in arXiv:0807.3368. The virtue of
the approach (i) is that it makes manifest the geometric properties of the N=2
supersymmetric sigma-models in AdS_4. The target space must be a non-compact
hyperkahler manifold endowed with a Killing vector field which generates an
SO(2) group of rotations on the two-sphere of complex structures. The power of
the approach (ii) is that it allows us, in principle, to generate hyperkahler
metrics as well as to address the problem of deformations of such metrics.

infinite number of N=1 AdS auxiliary superfields and performing a superfield
duality transformation. We also develop a novel description of the most general
N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-model in AdS_4 in terms of chiral
superfields on three-dimensional N=2 flat superspace without central charge.
This superspace naturally originates from a conformally flat realization for
the four-dimensional N=2 AdS superspace that makes use of Poincare coordinates
for AdS_4. This novel formulation allows us to uncover several interesting

define suitable spatial models for the interpolation of incomplete data. The

derive an explicit expression for the joint probability density function of the

we use to formulate a statistical test for isotropy. The approximate joint
density is independent of the autocovariance function and provides conservative

axial anomaly is equivalent to baryon number. CP-violation is explicit in the
scalar potential, but only in combination with P-violation is it possible for
an asymmetry to be generated. This is introduced through the leading C- and

the properties of Bessel and Mathieu functions, we derive the inequalities

performance trade-off between centralized and distributed processing. In our
model, a fraction $p$ of an available resource is deployed in a centralized
manner (e.g., to serve a most-loaded station) while the remaining fraction
$1-p$ is allocated to local servers that can only serve requests addressed
specifically to their respective stations.
  Using a fluid model approach, we demonstrate a surprising phase transition in
the steady-state delay, as $p$ changes: in the limit of a large number of
stations, and when any amount of centralization is available ($p>0$), the
average queue length in steady state scales as $\log_{1/(1-p)} 1/(1-\lambda)$
when the traffic intensity $\lambda$ goes to 1. This is exponentially smaller
than the usual M/M/1-queue delay scaling of $1/(1-\lambda)$, obtained when all
resources are fully allocated to local stations ($p=0$). This indicates a
strong qualitative impact of even a small degree of centralization.
  We prove convergence to a fluid limit, and characterize both the transient
and steady-state behavior of the finite system, in the limit as the number of
stations $N$ goes to infinity. We show that the sequence of queue-length
processes converges to a unique fluid trajectory (over any finite time
interval, as $N$ approaches infinity, and that this fluid trajectory converges
to a unique invariant state $v^I$, for which a simple closed-form expression is
obtained. We also show that the steady-state distribution of the $N$-server
system concentrates on $v^I$ as $N$ goes to infinity.

large-amplitude oscillations along filament axes that explains the restoring
force and damping mechanism. We have investigated the oscillations of multiple
threads formed in long, dipped flux tubes through the thermal nonequilibrium
process, and found that the oscillation properties predicted by our simulations
agree with the observed behavior. We then constructed a model for the
large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations that demonstrates that the restoring
force is the projected gravity in the tube where the threads oscillate.
Although the period is independent of the tube length and the constantly
growing mass, the motions are strongly damped by the steady accretion of mass
onto the threads by thermal nonequilibrium. The observations and our model
suggest that a nearby impulsive event drives the existing prominence threads
along their supporting tubes, away from the heating deposition site, without
destroying them. The subsequent oscillations occur because the displaced
threads reside in magnetic concavities with large radii of curvature. Our model
yields a powerful seismological method for constraining the coronal magnetic
field and radius of curvature of dips. Furthermore, these results indicate that
the magnetic structure is most consistent with the sheared-arcade model for
filament channels.

travels through the liquid and creates a fast, focused axisymmetric microjet

of this microjet using axisymmetric boundary-integral simulations, where we
model the pressure wave as a pressure pulse applied on the bubble. We find a

(AGB stars) are in transition to become Planetary Nebulae (PNe) are still
poorly understood. An important question is how the circumstellar envelopes of
AGB stars switch from spherical symmetry to the axially symmetric structures
frequently observed in PNe. In many cases there is clear evidence that the
shaping of the circumstellar envelopes of PNe is linked to the formation of
jets/collimated winds and their interaction with the remnant AGB envelope.
Because of the short evolutionary time, objects in this phase are rare, but
their identification provides valuable probes for testing evolutionary models.
We have observed (sub)millimeter CO rotational transitions with the APEX
telescope in a small sample of stars hosting high-velocity OH and water masers.
These targets are supposed to have recently left the AGB, as indicated by the
presence of winds traced by masers, with velocities larger than observed during
that phase. We have carried out observations of several CO lines, ranging from
J=2-1 up to J=7-6. In IRAS 15452-5459 we detect a fast molecular outflow in the
central region of the nebula and estimate a mass-loss rate between 1.2x10^{-4}
Msun yr^{-1} (assuming optically thin emission) and 4.9x10^{-4} Msun yr^{-1}
(optically thick emission). We model the SED of this target taking advantage of
our continuum measurement at 345 GHz to constrain the emission at long
wavelengths. For a distance of 2.5 kpc, we estimate a luminosity of 8000 Lsun
and a dust mass of 0.01 Msun. Through the flux in the [CII] line (158 um), we
calculate a total mass of about 12 Msun for the circumstellar envelope, but the

asymptotically high Reynolds numbers in incompressible fluids. It is based on a
two-fluids concept. Both components are materially identical and inviscid. The
first component is an ensemble of quasi-rigid dipole-vortex tubes as
quasi-particles in chaotic motion. The second is a superfluid performing
evasive motions between the tubes. The local dipole motions follow Helmholtz'
law. The vortex radii scale with the energy-containing length scale. Collisions
between quasi-particles lead either to annihilation (likewise rotation,
turbulent dissipation) or to scattering (counterrotation, turbulent diffusion).
There are analogies with birth and death processes of population dynamics and
their master equations. For free homogeneous decay the theory predicts the TKE
to follow 1/t. With an adiabatic condition at the wall it predicts the
logarithmic law with von Karman's constant as 1/\sqrt{2 pi} = 0.399. Likewise
rotating couples form dissipative patches almost at rest ($\rightarrow$
intermittency) wherein the spectrum evolves like an ""Apollonian gear"" as
discussed first by Herrmann, 1990. On this basis the prefactor of the

arsenide has led to an intensive search to optimize the superconducting
properties of iron-based superconductors by changing the chemical composition
of the spacer layer that is inserted between adjacent anionic iron arsenide
layers. Until now, superconductivity has only been found in compounds with a
cationic spacer layer consisting of metal ions: Li+, Na+, K+, Ba2+ or a
PbO-type or perovskite-type oxide layer. Electronic doping is usually necessary
to control the fine balance between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity.
Superconductivity has also been reported in FeSe, which contains neutral layers
similar in structure to those found in the iron arsenides but without the
spacer layer. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of Lix(NH2)y(NH3)1-yFe2Se2 (x
~0.6 ; y ~ 0.2), with lithium ions, lithium amide and ammonia acting as the
spacer layer, which exhibits superconductivity at 43(1) K, higher than in any
FeSe-derived compound reported so far and four times higher at ambient pressure
than the transition temperature, Tc, of the parent Fe1.01Se. We have determined
the crystal structure using neutron powder diffraction and used magnetometry
and muon-spin rotation data to determine the superconducting properties. This
new synthetic route opens up the possibility of further exploitation of related

noise on the image affects the bias on shear estimates from a
Maximum-Likelihood forward model-fitting approach using a sum of co-elliptical
S\'{e}rsic profiles, in complement to the theoretical approach of an an
associated paper. We evaluate the bias using a simple but realistic galaxy
model and find that the effects of noise alone can cause biases of order 1-10%
on measured shears, which is significant for current and future lensing
surveys. We evaluate a simulation-based calibration method to create a bias
model as a function of galaxy properties and observing conditions. This model
is then used to correct the simulated measurements. We demonstrate that this
method can effectively reduce noise bias so that shear measurement reaches the
level of accuracy required for estimating cosmic shear in upcoming lensing
surveys.

measurement of the mass distribution of the universe. A challenge for this
technique is to control systematic errors that occur when measuring the shapes
of distant galaxies. In this paper we investigate noise bias, a systematic
error that arises from second order noise terms in the shape measurement
process. We first derive analytical expressions for the bias of general Maximum
Likelihood Estimators (MLEs) in the presence of additive noise. We then find
analytical expressions for a simplified toy model in which galaxies are modeled
and fitted with a Gaussian with its size as a single free parameter. Even for
this very simple case we find a significant effect. We also extend our analysis
to a more realistic 6-parameter elliptical Gaussian model. We find that the
noise bias is generically of the order of the inverse-squared signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of the galaxies and is thus of the order of a percent for galaxies
of SNR of 10, i.e. comparable to the weak lensing shear signal. This is nearly
two orders of magnitude greater than the systematics requirements for future
all-sky weak lensing surveys. We discuss possible ways to circumvent this
effect, including a calibration method using simulations discussed in an
associated paper.

the Gr\""obner bases theory). Finally, we explain how to ""deform"" the
differential to handle every operad with a Gr\""obner basis, and find explicit
representatives of Quillen homology classes for a large class of operads. We
also present various applications, including a new proof of Hoffbeck's PBW

with excitonic transitions is fundamental for biological function as it
generates non-cascaded transport with rapid and wider spatial distribution of
excitation energy. Our work also indicates that the non-equilibrium dynamics of
such vibrations can manifest itself in ultrafast beating of both excitonic
populations and coherences at room temperature, with time scales in agreement
with those reported in experiments. Moreover, we show that mechanisms
supporting coherent excitonic dynamics assist coupling to selected modes that
channel energy to preferential sites in the complex. We therefore argue that,
in the presence of strong coupling between electronic excitations and quantized
vibrations, a concrete and important advantage of quantum coherent dynamics is
precisely to tune resonances that promote fast and effective energy
distribution.

significant fractions of the dense circumnuclear gas have high kinetic
temperatures, which are hard to explain by pure photon excitation, but may be
caused by dissipation of turbulent energy.
  Aims. We aim to determine to what extent mechanical heating should be taken
into account while modelling PDRs. To this end, the effect of dissipated
turbulence on the thermal and chemical properties of PDRs is explored. Methods.
Clouds are modelled as 1D semi-infinite slabs whose thermal and chemical
equilibrium is solved for using the Leiden PDR-XDR code.
  Results. In a steady-state treatment, mechanical heating seems to play an
important role in determining the kinetic temperature of the gas in molecular
clouds. Particularly in high-energy environments such as starburst galaxies and
galaxy centers, model gas temperatures are underestimated by at least a factor
of two if mechanical heating is ignored. The models also show that CO, HCN and
H2 O column densities increase as a function of mechanical heating. The HNC/HCN
integrated column density ratio shows a decrease by a factor of at least two in
high density regions with n \sim 105 cm-3, whereas that of HCN/HCO+ shows a
strong dependence on mechanical heating for this same density range, with
boosts of up to three orders of magnitude.
  Conclusions. The effects of mechanical heating cannot be ignored in studies
of the molecular gas excitation whenever the ratio of the star formation rate
to the gas density is close to, or exceeds, 7 \times 10-6 M yr-1 cm4.5 . If
mechanical heating is not included, predicted column densities are
underestimated, sometimes even by a few orders of magnitude. As a lower bound
to its importance, we determined that it has non-negligible effects already
when mechanical heating is as little as 1% of the UV heating in a PDR.

masking instrument FIRST. Its principle relies on the combination of spatial
filtering and aperture masking using single-mode fibers, a novel technique that
is aimed at high dynamic range imaging with high angular resolution. The
prototype has been tested with the Shane 3-m telescope at Lick Observatory. The
entrance pupil is divided into subpupils feeding single-mode fibers. The flux
injection into the fibers is optimized by a segmented mirror. The beams are
spectrally dispersed and recombined in a non-redundant exit configuration in
order to retrieve all contrasts and phases independently. The instrument works
at visible wavelengths between 600 nm and 760 nm and currently uses nine of the
30 43 cm subapertures constituting the full pupil. First fringes were obtained
on Vega and Deneb. Stable closure phases were measured with standard deviations
on the order of 1 degree. Closure phase precision can be further improved by
addressing some of the remaining sources of systematic errors. While the number
of fibers used in the experiment was too small to reliably estimate visibility
amplitudes, we have measured closure amplitudes with a precision of 10 % in the
best case. These first promising results obtained under real observing
conditions validate the concept of the fibered aperture masking instrument and
open the way for a new type of ground-based instrument working in the visible.
The next steps of the development will be to improve the stability and the
sensitivity of the instrument in order to achieve more accurate closure phase
and visibility measurements, and to increase the number of sub-pupils to reach
full pupil coverage.

defined rings around the centroid of the image is obtained. The KDFPE is then
applied to the vector of the image. KDFPE is invariant to translation, scale

ARGOS is designed to bring a moderate but uniform reduction of the PSF size
over a FoV as large as 4x4arcmin, allowing a significative increase of the
science throughput of LUCI, the LBT NIR imager and MOS. ARGOS relays on 3
Rayleigh beacons to sense the lower layers of the atmosphere achieving almost
100% sky coverage. The ground layer AO correction is allowed by the 2 adaptive
secondaries of the LBT. This PhD thesis first discusses a study based on
numerical simulations and aimed to evaluate the performance of ARGOS. This work
has been carried out using CAOS and representing in the code most of the
features that characterize the system itself: as the laser beacon propagation
in the atmosphere, the SH type wavefront sensing, the AO reconstruction and
closed loop delays and the atmosphere tip-tilt sensing done using a NGS and a
quad-cell type sensor. The results obtained in this study are in agreement and
definitively confirm the performance evaluated in the phase studies of the
project. This study shows that ARGOS is able to produce a reduction of a factor
2 of the seeing bringing to a gain of a factor 4 in the integration time
required by LUCI. This PhD thesis reports also the optical design and
optimization of both the ARGOS dichroic window, used to separate the laser
light from the science light, and the LGS WFS, that evaluates the ground layer
aberrations averaging the SH measurements in the direction of the 3 LGS. For
both of the subsystems the optimization process is analyzed. Then are evaluated
the tolerances and specifications for the production and coating of the optics.

  Data driven extension words were found to help in over 70% of difficult

This is less
obvious for engineering networks (electric power, gas, water, transportation
systems etc.) that are expected to operate under normal conditions most of
time. As a result, the ability of a network to withstand massive sudden damage
caused by adverse events (or survivability) has not been among traditional
goals in the network design. Reality, however, calls for the adjustment of
design priorities. As modern networks develop toward increasing their size,
complexity, and integration, the likelihood of adverse events increases too due
to technological development, climate change, and activities in the political
arena among other factors. Under such circumstances, a network failure has an
unprecedented effect on lives and economy. To mitigate the impact of adverse
events on the network operability, the survivability analysis must be conducted
at the early stage of the network design. Such analysis requires the
development of new analytical and computational tools. Computational analysis
of the network survivability is the exponential time problem at least. The
current paper describes a new algorithm, in which the reduction of the
computational complexity is achieved by mapping an initial network topology
with multiple sources and sinks onto a set of simpler smaller topologies with
multiple sources and a single sink. Steps for further reducing the time and
space expenses of computations are also discussed.

most of the radiation at these bands originates in shocks. OB and WR stars
present supersonic and massive winds that, when colliding, emit largely due to
the free-free radiation. The non-thermal radio and X-ray emissions are due to
synchrotron and inverse compton processes, respectively. In this case, magnetic
fields are expected to play an important role on the emission distribution. In
the past few years the modeling of the free-free and synchrotron emissions from
massive binary systems have been based on purely hydrodynamical simulations,
and ad hoc assumptions regarding the distribution of magnetic energy and the

simulations of wind-wind collision in massive binary systems. We study the
free-free emission characterizing its dependence on the stellar and orbital

at the shock region, obtaining also the synchrotron energy distribution
integrated along different lines of sight. We show that the magnetic field in
the shocks is larger than that obtained when the proportionality between $B$
and the plasma density is assumed. Also, we show that the role of the
synchrotron emission relative to the total radio emission has been
underestimated.

fermionic atoms via a micro-canonical transport formalism within both
mean-field and a higher-order approximation, as well as with time-dependent
DMRG. For weakly repulsive interactions, a quasi steady-state atomic current
develops that is similar to the situation occurring for electronic systems
subject to an external voltage bias. At the mean-field level, we find that this
atomic current is robust against the details of how the interaction is switched
on. Further, a conducting-to-nonconducting transition exists when the
interaction imbalance exceeds some threshold from both our approximate and
time-dependent DMRG simulations. This transition is preceded by the atomic
equivalent of negative differential conductivity observed in transport across
solid-state structures.

This problem includes environments where agents have budgets, risk preferences,
or multi-dimensional preferences over several possible configurations of the
good (furthermore, it allows an agent's budget and risk preference to be known
only privately to the agent). These are the main challenge areas for auction
theory. A single-agent problem is to optimize a given objective subject to a
constraint on the maximum probability with which each type is allocated,
a.k.a., an allocation rule. Our approach is a reduction from multi-agent
mechanism design problem to collection of single-agent problems. We focus on
maximizing revenue, but our results can be applied to other objectives (e.g.,
welfare).
  An optimal multi-agent mechanism can be computed by a linear/convex program
on interim allocation rules by simultaneously optimizing several single-agent
mechanisms subject to joint feasibility of the allocation rules. For
single-unit auctions, Border \citeyearpar{B91} showed that the space of all
jointly feasible interim allocation rules for $n$ agents is a
$\NumTypes$-dimensional convex polytope which can be specified by $2^\NumTypes$
linear constraints, where $\NumTypes$ is the total number of all agents' types.
Consequently, efficiently solving the mechanism design problem requires a
separation oracle for the feasibility conditions and also an algorithm for
ex-post implementation of the interim allocation rules. We show that the
polytope of jointly feasible interim allocation rules is the projection of a
higher dimensional polytope which can be specified by only $O(\NumTypes^2)$
linear constraints. Furthermore, our proof shows that finding a preimage of the
interim allocation rules in the higher dimensional polytope immediately gives
an ex-post implementation.

the nature of the dark lane. Methods. We use the heterodyne receiver GREAT on
board SOFIA to observe velocity resolved spectral lines of [C II] and CO 11-10
in comparison with so far unpublished submm continuum data at 350 micron
(SHARC-II) and complementary molecular line data. Results. The high angular and
spectral resolution observations show a very complex morphology and kinematics
of the inner S106 region, with many different components at different
excitation conditions contributing to the observed emission. The [C II] lines
are found to be bright and very broad, tracing high velocity gas close to the
interface of molecular cloud and HII region. CO 11-10 emission is more
confined, both spatially and in velocity, to the immediate surroundings of S106
IR showing the presence of warm, high density (clumpy) gas. Our high angular
resolution submm continuum observations rule out the scenario where the dark
lane separating the two lobes is due solely to the shadow cast by a small disk
close to the star. The lane is clearly seen also as warm, high column density
gas at the boundary of the molecular cloud and HII region.

capable of determining global climate on long timescales. Here we show that
terrestrial exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars may be tidally heated at high
enough levels to induce a runaway greenhouse for a long enough duration for all
the hydrogen to escape. Without hydrogen, the planet no longer has water and
cannot support life. We call these planets ""Tidal Venuses,"" and the phenomenon
a ""tidal greenhouse."" Tidal effects also circularize the orbit, which decreases
tidal heating. Hence, some planets may form with large eccentricity, with its
accompanying large tidal heating, and lose their water, but eventually settle
into nearly circular orbits (i.e. with negligible tidal heating) in the
habitable zone (HZ). However, these planets are not habitable as past tidal
heating desiccated them, and hence should not be ranked highly for detailed
follow-up observations aimed at detecting biosignatures. Planets orbiting stars
with masses <0.3 solar masses may be in danger of desiccation via tidal
heating. We apply these concepts to Gl 667C c, a ~4.5 Earth-mass planet
orbiting a 0.3 solar mass star at 0.12 AU. We find that it probably did not
lose its water via tidal heating as orbital stability is unlikely for the high
eccentricities required for the tidal greenhouse. As the inner edge of the HZ
is defined by the onset of a runaway or moist greenhouse powered by radiation,
our results represent a fundamental revision to the HZ for non-circular orbits.
In the appendices we review a) the moist and runaway greenhouses, b) hydrogen
escape, c) stellar mass-radius and mass-luminosity relations, d) terrestrial
planet mass-radius relations, and e) linear tidal theories. [abridged]

number of neutrino species $N_{\rm{eff}}$. This survey has recently benefited
from an accurate calibration of the redshift distribution, allowing new
measurements of the (non-linear) matter power spectrum in a unique range of
scales and redshifts sensitive to neutrino free streaming. Our analysis makes
use of a recent model for the effect of neutrinos on the weakly non-linear
matter power spectrum derived from accurate N-body simulations. We show that
CFHTLS, combined with WMAP7 and a prior on the Hubble constant provides an
upper limit of $\sum{m_\nu}<0.29\,$eV and $N_{\rm{eff}} =4.17^{+1.62}_{-1.26}$

affected by non-linearities, these constraints become $\sum{m_\nu}<0.41\,$eV

the same time, the SM is incomplete, since additional dynamics are required to
accommodate cosmological dark matter (DM). In this paper we show that
interactions between weak scale DM and the Higgs which are strong enough to
yield a thermal relic abundance consistent with observation can easily
destabilize the electroweak vacuum or drive the theory into a non-perturbative
regime at a low scale. As a consequence, new physics--beyond the DM
itself--must enter at a cutoff well below the Planck scale and in some cases as
low as O(10 - 1000 TeV), a range relevant to indirect probes of flavor and CP
violation. In addition, this cutoff is correlated with the DM mass and
scattering cross-section in a parameter space which will be probed
experimentally in the near term. Specifically, we consider the SM plus
additional spin 0 or 1/2 states with singlet, triplet, or doublet electroweak
quantum numbers and quartic or Yukawa couplings to the Higgs boson. We derive
explicit expressions for the full two-loop RGEs and one-loop threshold

advances in information and computation technology, and have transformed the
ways in which astronomy is done. We describe the variety and the general
properties of surveys, the ways in which they may be quantified and compared,
and offer some figures of merit that can be used to compare their scientific
discovery potential. Surveys enable a very wide range of science; that is
perhaps their key unifying characteristic. As new domains of the observable
parameter space open up thanks to the advances in technology, surveys are often
the initial step in their exploration. Science can be done with the survey data
alone or a combination of different surveys, or with a targeted follow-up of
potentially interesting selected sources. Surveys can be used to generate
large, statistical samples of objects that can be studied as populations, or as
tracers of larger structures. They can be also used to discover or generate
samples of rare or unusual objects, and may lead to discoveries of some
previously unknown types. We discuss a general framework of parameter spaces
that can be used for an assessment and comparison of different surveys, and the
strategies for their scientific exploration. As we move into the Petascale

the loss is two level system in nature and is correlated with the amount of Al

the remaining loss is linearly related to the product of the Al area times its

elevated temperature, additional loss is correlated with the amount of Al in

Space Telescope has provided a rare opportunity to study high energy photon
emission from gamma-ray bursts. Although the majority of such events (27) have
been iden tified by the Fermi LAT Collaboration, four were uncovered by using
more sensiti ve statistical techniques (Akerlof et al 2010, Akerlof et al 2011,
Zheng et al 2 012). In this paper, we continue our earlier work by finding
three more GRBs ass ociated with high energy photon emission, GRB 110709A,
111117A and 120107A. To s ystematize our matched filter approach, a pipeline
has been developed to identif y these objects in near real time. GRB 120107A is
the first product of this anal ysis procedure. Despite the reduced threshold
for identification, the number of GRB events has not increased significantly.
This relative dearth of events with low photon number prompted a study of the
apparent photon number distribution. W e find an extremely good fit to a simple
power-law with an exponent of -1.8 $\pm $ 0.3 for the differential
distribution. As might be expected, there is a substa ntial correlation between
the number of lower energy photons detected by the GBM and the number observed
by the LAT. Thus, high energy photon emission is associ ated with some but not
all of the brighter GBM events. Deeper studies of the pro perties of the small
population of high energy emitting bursts may eventually yi eld a better
understanding of these entire phenomena.

  Based on the characteristics of the stellar atmosphere/line formation code
FASTWIND, we designed and created a grid of models for the analysis of massive
blue supergiant stars. Along with this new grid, we implemented a spectral
analysis algorithm. Both tools were specially developed to perform fully
consistent quantitative spectroscopic analyses of low spectral resolution of
B-type supergiants in a fast and objective way.
  We present the main characteristics of our FASTWIND model grid and perform a
number of tests to investigate the reliability of our methodology. The
automatic tool is applied afterward to a sample of 12 B-type supergiant stars
in NGC55, deriving the stellar parameters and abundances. The results indicate
that our stars are part of a young population evolving towards a red supergiant
phase. The derived chemical composition hints to an average metallicity similar

AGN due to the difference between the AGN lifetime and triggering timescales.
Here, we utilize AGN population synthesis modeling to determine the importance
of different AGN triggering mechanisms. An AGN population model is computed by
combining an observationally motivated AGN triggering rate and a theoretical
AGN light curve. The free parameters of the AGN light curve are constrained by
minimizing a \chi squared test with respect to the observed AGN hard X-ray
luminosity function. The observed black hole space density, AGN number counts,
and X-ray background spectrum are also considered as observational constraints.
It is found that major mergers are not able to account for the entire AGN
population. Therefore, non-merger processes, such as secular mechanisms, must
also trigger AGN. Indeed, non-merger processes are the dominant AGN triggering
mechanism at z \lesssim 1--1.5. Furthermore, the shape and evolution of the
black hole mass function of AGN triggered by major mergers is intrinsically
different from the shape and evolution of the black hole mass function of AGN
triggered by secular processes.

like content optimization, computational advertising, and many more. While
bilinear random effect models (matrix factorization) provide state-of-the-art
performance when minimizing RMSE through a Gaussian response model on explicit
ratings data, applying it to imbalanced binary response data presents
additional challenges that we carefully study in this paper. Data in many
applications usually consist of users' implicit response that are often binary
-- clicking an item or not; the goal is to predict click rates, which is often
combined with other measures to calculate utilities to rank items at runtime of
the recommender systems. Because of the implicit nature, such data are usually
much larger than explicit rating data and often have an imbalanced distribution
with a small fraction of click events, making accurate click rate prediction
difficult. In this paper, we address two problems. First, we show previous
techniques to estimate bilinear random effect models with binary data are less
accurate compared to our new approach based on adaptive rejection sampling,
especially for imbalanced response. Second, we develop a parallel bilinear
random effect model fitting framework using Map-Reduce paradigm that scales to
massive datasets. Our parallel algorithm is based on a ""divide and conquer""
strategy coupled with an ensemble approach. Through experiments on the
benchmark MovieLens data, a small Yahoo! Front Page data set, and a large
Yahoo! Front Page data set that contains 8M users and 1B binary observations,
we show that careful handling of binary response as well as identifiability
issues are needed to achieve good performance for click rate prediction, and
that the proposed adaptive rejection sampler and the partitioning as well as
ensemble techniques significantly improve model performance.

dark matter N-body simulations. We find that the standard Navarro-Frenk-White

practical applications, we derive analytic relations, e.g., for the f(R) scalar
field, the gravitational potential, and the velocity dispersion as seen within
the virialized clusters. These functions are based on three degrees of freedom
fitted to simulations, i.e., the characteristic density, scale, and velocity
dispersion. We further analyze predictions for these fitting parameters from
the gravitational collapse and the Jeans equation, which are found to agree
well with the simulations. Our analytic results can be used to consistently
constrain chameleon f(R) gravity with future observations on virialized cluster

multiple snapshots of an evolving complex network that can help uncover how
dense clusters in a network emerge, combine, split and decay with time. Current
methods for finding communities in a single snapshot are not straightforwardly
generalizable to finding temporal communities since the quality functions used
for finding static communities have highly degenerate landscapes, and the
eventual partition chosen among the many partitions of similar quality is
highly sensitive to small changes in the network. To reliably detect temporal
communities we need not only to find a good community partition in a given
snapshot but also ensure that it bears some similarity to the partition(s)
found in immediately preceding snapshots. We present a new measure of partition
distance called ""estrangement"" motivated by the inertia of inter-node
relationships which, when incorporated into the measurement of partition
quality, facilitates the detection of meaningful temporal communities.
Specifically, we propose the estrangement confinement method, which postulates
that neighboring nodes in a community prefer to continue to share community
affiliation as the network evolves. Constraining estrangement enables us to
find meaningful temporal communities at various degrees of temporal smoothness
in diverse real-world datasets. Specifically, we study the evolution of voting
behavior of senators in the United States Congress, the evolution of proximity
in human mobility datasets, and the detection of evolving communities in
synthetic networks that are otherwise hard to find. Estrangement confinement
thus provides a principled approach to uncovering temporal communities in
evolving networks.

operations per pixel, where \sigma_s is the (effective) width of the spatial
kernel. A fast implementation of the bilateral filter was recently proposed in
[2] that required O(1) operations per pixel with respect to \sigma_s. This was
done by using trigonometric functions for the range kernel of the bilateral
filter, and by exploiting their so-called shiftability property. In particular,
a fast implementation of the Gaussian bilateral filter was realized by
approximating the Gaussian range kernel using raised cosines. Later, it was
demonstrated in [3] that this idea could be extended to a larger class of
filters, including the popular non-local means filter [4]. As already observed
in [2], a flip side of this approach was that the run time depended on the
width \sigma_r of the range kernel. For an image with (local) intensity
variations in the range [0,T], the run time scaled as O(T^2/\sigma^2_r) with
\sigma_r. This made it difficult to implement narrow range kernels,
particularly for images with large dynamic range. We discuss this problem in
this note, and propose some simple steps to accelerate the implementation in
general, and for small \sigma_r in particular.

In this paper we analyze the flow in the \textit{inverse cascade} range at a
small but fixed Rossby number, {$\mathcal{R}o_f \approx 0.05$}. Several
{numerical simulations with} helical and non-helical forcing functions are
considered in periodic boxes with unit aspect ratio. In order to resolve the
inverse cascade range with {reasonably} large Reynolds number, the analysis is
based on large eddy simulations which include the effect of helicity on eddy
viscosity and eddy noise. Thus, we model the small scales and resolve
explicitly the large scales. We show that the large-scale energy spectrum has
at least two solutions: one that is consistent with
Kolmogorov-Kraichnan-Batchelor-Leith phenomenology for the inverse cascade of
energy in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence with a {$\sim k_{\perp}^{-5/3}$}
scaling, and the other that corresponds to a steeper {$\sim k_{\perp}^{-3}$}

fraction of their energy per unit time to 2D modes. {The spectrum that} emerges
{depends on} the anisotropy of the forcing function{,} the former solution
prevailing for forcings in which more energy is injected into 2D modes while
the latter prevails for isotropic forcing. {In the case of anisotropic forcing,
whence the energy} goes from the 2D to the 3D modes at low wavenumbers,
large-scale shear is created resulting in another time scale $\tau_{sh}$,
associated with shear, {thereby producing} a $\sim k^{-1}$ spectrum for the
{total energy} with the 2D modes still following a {$\sim k_{\perp}^{-5/3}$}

that, among other things, have a basis-like structure and multi resolution
analysis properties. These relatively new representation systems have
encountered wide range of applications, generally surpassing the performance of
their ancestors due to their directional sensitivity. However, little is known
about their relation with spaces other than $L^2$. Here, we find a
characterization of a kind of anisotropic inhomogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin spaces
(to be defined) with the so called ""shearlets on the cone"" coefficients. We
first prove the boundedness of the analysis and synthesis operators with the
""traditional"" shearlets coefficients. Then, with the development of the smooth
Parseval frames of shearlets of Guo and Labate we are able to prove a
reproducing identity, which was previously possible only for the $L^2$ case. We
also find some embeddings of the (classical) dyadic spaces into these highly
anisotropic spaces, and viceversa, for certain ranges of parameters. In order
to keep a concise document we develop our results in the ""weightless"" case
($w=1$) and give hints on how to develop the weighted case.

combinatorial description of those permutations $\sigma$ for which $\sigma
\circ f$ is still (topologically) mixing, and show that the proportion of such
permutations tends to $1$ as $N \to \infty$. We then investigate the mixing
rate of $\sigma \circ f$ (as measured by the modulus of the second largest

continuous time diffusive systems, we show that composition with a permutation
cannot improve the mixing rate of $f$, but typically makes it worse. Under some
mild assumptions on $m$ and $N$, we obtain a precise value for the worst mixing
rate as $\sigma$ ranges through all permutations; this can be made arbitrarily
close to $1$ as $N \to \infty$ (with $m$ fixed). We illustrate the geometric
distribution of the second largest eigenvalues in the complex plane for small
$m$ and $N$, and propose a conjecture concerning their location in general.
Finally, we give examples of other interval maps $f$ for which composition with
permutations produces different behaviour than that obtained from the

six-dimensional space G6 by algebraic analysis and organized random probing of
regions near 1- through 8-fold boundary polytope intersections. We limit
consideration of boundary polytopes to those avoiding the mathematically
interesting but crystallographically impossible cases of 0 length cell edges.
Combinations of boundary polytopes without a valid intersection in the closure
of the Niggli cone or with an intersection that would force a cell edge to 0 or
without neighboring probe points are eliminated. 216 boundary polytopes are
found: 15 5-D boundary polytopes of the full G6 Niggli cone, 53 4-D boundary
polytopes resulting from intersections of pairs of the 15 5-D boundary
polytopes, 79 3-D boundary polytopes resulting from 2-fold, 3-fold and 4-fold

with the violation of tree-level unitarity. However, we show that this is
parametrically incorrect in the case of chiral perturbation theory, and is
probably theoretically incorrect in general. In the chiral theory, we explore
perturbative unitarity violation as a function of the number of colors and the
number of flavors, holding the scale of the ""new physics"" (i.e. QCD) fixed.
This demonstrates that the onset of new physics is parametrically uncorrelated
with tree-unitarity violation. When the latter scale is lower than that of new
physics, the effective theory must heal its unitarity violation itself, which
is expected because the field theory satisfies the requirements of unitarity.
In the chiral theory, the self-healing results in a resonant structure with
scalar quantum numbers. In the electroweak variant of this argument, the
structure must have the properties of the Higgs and must couple proportional to
the mass in both gauge boson and fermion scattering. A similar example can be
seen in the case of general relativity coupled to multiple matter fields, where
iteration of the vacuum polarization diagram restores unitarity. We present
arguments that suggest the correct identification should be connected to the
onset of inelasticity rather than unitarity violation. We describe how the
onset of inelasticity can occur in the effective theory, although it does not
appear possible to predict the onset reliably.

Romanova et al. to include a well defined magnetospheric accretion funnel flow
which is essential for modelling the optical and near-infrared hydrogen and
helium lines of CTTSs. The MHD model with an intermediate mass-accretion rate
shows outflows in conical-shell shape with a half opening angle about 35
degrees. The flow properties such as the maximum outflow speed in the
conical-shell wind, maximum inflow speed in the accretion funnel,
mass-accretion and mass-loss rates are comparable to those found in a typical
CTTS. The density, velocity and modified temperature from the MHD simulations
are used in a separate radiative transfer model to predict the line profiles
and test the consistency of the MHD models with observations. The line profiles
are computed with various combinations of X-ray luminosities, temperatures of
X-ray emitting plasma, and inclination angles. A rich diversity of line profile
morphology is found, and many of the model profiles are very similar to those
found in observations. We find that the conical-shell wind may contribute to
the emission in some hydrogen lines (e.g. H-alpha, H-beta, Pa-beta and
Pa-gamma) significantly when the temperature in the wind is relatively high
(e.g. \sim 10^{4} K); however, the wind contribution decreases rapidly when a
lower wind temperature is adopted. The model well reproduces a relatively
narrow and low-velocity blueshifted absorption component in He I (10830), which
are often seen in observations.

slightly stronger definition of smoothness also implies a Bayes-Nash PoA bound.
We show how weighted congestion games actually satisfy this stronger definition
of smoothness. This allows us to show that the inefficiency bounds of weighted
congestion games known in the literature carry over to incomplete versions
where the weights of the players are private information. We also show how an
incomplete version of a natural class of monotone valid utility games, called
effort market games are universally $(1,1)$-smooth. Hence, we show that
incomplete versions of effort market games where the abilities of the players
and their budgets are private information has Bayes-Nash PoA at most 2.

orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is proposed based on the
selected mapping (SLM) scheme. The proposed SLM scheme generates alternative
OFDM signal sequences by cyclically shifting the connections in each subblock
at an intermediate stage of inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). Compared
with the conventional SLM scheme, the proposed SLM scheme achieves similar PAPR
reduction performance with much lower computational complexity and no bit error
rate (BER) degradation. The performance of the proposed SLM scheme is verified
through numerical analysis. Also, it is shown that the proposed SLM scheme has
the lowest computational complexity among the existing low-complexity SLM
schemes exploiting the signals at an intermediate stage of IFFT.

reproducing kernel is given by an integral representation using the truncated
power function $(\boldsymbol{x} \cdot \boldsymbol{z} - t)_+^{\beta-1}$ defined
on spherical caps centered at $\boldsymbol{z}$ of height $t$, which reduce to
an integral over indicator functions of spherical caps as studied in [J.
Brauchart, J. Dick, arXiv:1101.4448v1 [math.NA], to appear in Proc. Amer. Math.
Soc.] for $\beta = 1$. This is in analogy to the generalization of the
reproducing kernel to arbitrary smoothness on the unit cube.
  We show that the reproducing kernel is a sum of a Kamp{\'e} de F{\'e}riet
function and the Euclidean distance $\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{y}\|$ of the
arguments of the kernel raised to the power of $2\beta -1$ if $2\beta - 1$ is
not an even integer; otherwise the logarithm of the distance
$\|\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{y}\|$ appears. For $\beta \in \mathbb{N}$ the
Kamp\'e de F\'eriet function reduces to a polynomial, giving a simple closed
form expression for the reproducing kernel.
  Using this space we can generalize Stolarsky's invariance principle to
arbitrary smoothness. Previously, Warnock's formula, which is the analogue to
Stolarsky's invariance principle for the unit cube $[0,1]^s$, has been
generalized using similar techniques [J. Dick, Ann. Mat. Pura. Appl., (4) 187

stable due to what is generically known as non-renormalization theorems. As a
result, all (equilibrium) dynamical models are divided into three major
categories: Markovian models with unbroken Q-symmetry, chaotic models with
Q-symmetry spontaneously broken on the mean-field level by, e.g., fractal
invariant sets (e.g., strange attractors), and intermittent or self-organized
critical (SOC) models with Q-symmetry dynamically broken by the condensation of
instanton-antiinstanton configurations (earthquakes, avalanches etc.) SOC is a
full-dimensional phase separating chaos and Markovian dynamics. In the
deterministic limit, however, antiinstantons disappear and SOC collapses into
the ""edge of chaos"". Goldstone theorem stands behind spatio-temporal
self-similarity of Q-broken phases known under such names as algebraic
statistics of avalanches, 1/f noise, sensitivity to initial conditions etc.
Other fundamental differences of Q-broken phases is that they can be
effectively viewed as quantum dynamics and that they must also have
time-reversal symmetry spontaneously broken. Q-symmetry breaking in
non-equilibrium situations (quenches, Barkhausen effect, etc.) is also briefly
discussed.

Scattering on random inhomogeneity of the waveguide leads to wave chaos. Chaos
reveals itself in spectral properties of the finite-range evolution operator
(FREO). FREO describes transformation of a wavefield in course of propagation
along a finite segment of a waveguide. We study transition to chaos by tracking
variations in spectral statistics with increasing length of the segment.
Analysis of the FREO is accompanied with ray calculations using the one-step
Poincar\'e map which is the classical counterpart of the FREO. Underwater sound
channel in the Sea of Japan is taken for an example. Several methods of
spectral analysis are utilized. In particular, we approximate level spacing
statistics by means of the Berry-Robnik and Brody distributions, explore the
spectrum using the procedure elaborated by A. Relano with coworkers (Relano et
al, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2002; Relano, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2008), and analyze modal
expansions of the eigenfunctions. We show that the analysis of FREO
eigenfunctions is more informative than the analysis of eigenvalue statistics.
It is found that near-axial sound propagation in the Sea of Japan preserves
stability even over distances of hundreds kilometers. This phenomenon is
associated with the presence of a shearless torus in the classical phase space.
Increasing of acoustic wavelength degrades scattering, resulting in recovery of
localization near periodic orbits of the one-step Poincar\'e map. Relying upon
the formal analogy between wave and quantum chaos, we suggest that the concept
of FREO, supported by classical calculations via the one-step Poincar\'e map,
can be efficiently applied for studying chaos-induced decoherence in quantum
systems.

of our machinery is an exact context which can be easily obtained from a rigid
morphism that exists in very general circumstances. The output is a recollement
of derived module categories of rings in which the noncommutative tensor
product of an exact context plays a crucial role. Thus we obtain a large
variety of new recollements from commutative and noncommutative localizations,
ring epimorphisms and extensions.

In this model the Higgs boson primarily undergoes a cascade decay to four charm
quarks via light intermediate pseudoscalars. Such a decay allows the Higgs
boson to escape the most stringent LEP bounds on the Standard Model Higgs boson
mass. If the light pseudoscalars are sufficiently light they become highly
boosted and their decay products collimated into jets. We show that by using
jet substructure techniques, this model is potentially observable at the LHC.

present on a real-space grid. For long double chains, the excitation is similar
to that in long single atomic chains, showing longitudinal modes, end and
central transverse modes. However, for 2-D planes consisting of ($n \times n$)
atoms with $n$ up to 16, new 2-D characteristic modes emerge regardless of the
symmetries considered. For a kick parallel to the plane, besides the equivalent
end mode, mixed modes with contrary polarity occur, while for an impulse
perpendicular to the plane there will be corner, side center, bulk center, and
circuit modes. Our calculation reveals the importance of dimensionality for
plasmon excitation and how it evolves from 1-D to 2-D.

finite statistical mixtures of exponential families such as Gaussian mixture
models. Mixture models are traditionally learned using the
expectation-maximization (EM) soft clustering technique that monotonically
increases the incomplete (expected complete) likelihood. Given prescribed
mixture weights, the hard clustering $k$-MLE algorithm iteratively assigns data
to the most likely weighted component and update the component models using
Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs). Using the duality between exponential
families and Bregman divergences, we prove that the local convergence of the
complete likelihood of $k$-MLE follows directly from the convergence of a dual
additively weighted Bregman hard clustering. The inner loop of $k$-MLE can be
implemented using any $k$-means heuristic like the celebrated Lloyd's batched
or Hartigan's greedy swap updates. We then show how to update the mixture
weights by minimizing a cross-entropy criterion that implies to update weights
by taking the relative proportion of cluster points, and reiterate the mixture
parameter update and mixture weight update processes until convergence. Hard EM
is interpreted as a special case of $k$-MLE when both the component update and
the weight update are performed successively in the inner loop. To initialize
$k$-MLE, we propose $k$-MLE++, a careful initialization of $k$-MLE guaranteeing
probabilistically a global bound on the best possible complete likelihood.

compressible Navier-Stokes system in an impermeable fixed bounded domain. We
consider two kinds of boundary conditions. The first one is the no-slip
condition. In this case we extend the famous conditional result obtained by
Kato in the homogeneous incompressible case. Kato proved that if the energy
dissipation rate of the viscous flow in a boundary layer of width proportional
to the viscosity vanishes then the solutions of the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations converge to some solutions of the incompressible Euler
equations in the energy space. We provide here a natural extension of this
result to the compressible case. The other case is the Navier condition which
encodes that the fluid slips with some friction on the boundary. In this case
we show that the convergence to the Euler equations holds true in the energy
space, as least when the friction is not too large. In both cases we use in a
crucial way some relative energy estimates proved recently by Feireisl, Ja Jin

unaffected over cosmological distances, carrying information from the innermost
regions of the astrophysical engines. Such messengers could also reveal new,
hidden sources that have not been observed by conventional photon-based
astronomy. Coincident observation of GWs and HENs may thus play a critical role
in multimessenger astronomy. This is particularly true at the present time
owing to the advent of a new generation of dedicated detectors: IceCube,

red supergiant VY CMa. We obtained near-infrared spectro-interferometric
observations of VY CMa with spectral resolutions of 35 and 1500 using the AMBER
instrument at the VLTI. The visibility data indicate the presence of molecular
layers of water vapor and CO in the extended atmosphere with an asymmetric
morphology. The uniform disk diameter in the water band around 2.0 mu is
increased by \sim20% compared to the near-continuum bandpass at 2.20-2.25 mu
and in the CO band at 2.3-2.5 mu it is increased by up to \sim50%. The closure
phases indicate relatively small deviations from point symmetry close to the
photospheric layer, and stronger deviations in the extended H2O and CO layers.
Making use of the high spatial and spectral resolution, a near-continuum
bandpass can be isolated from contamination by molecular and dusty layers, and
the Rosseland-mean photospheric angular diameter is estimated to 11.3 +/- 0.3
mas based on a PHOENIX atmosphere model. Together with recent high-precision
estimates of the distance and spectro-photometry, this estimate corresponds to
a radius of 1420 +/- 120 Rsun and an effective temperature of 3490 +/- 90 K. VY
CMa exhibits asymmetric, possibly clumpy, atmospheric layers of H2O and CO,
which are not co-spatial, within a larger elongated dusty envelope. Our revised
fundamental parameters put VY CMa close to the Hayashi limit of recent
evolutionary tracks of initial mass 25 Msun with rotation or 32 Msun without
rotation, shortly before evolving blueward in the HR-diagram.

enough to influence major companies to adopt it into their mainstream business.
A strong thrust on the use of virtualization technology to realize
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) has led enterprises to leverage
subscription-oriented computing capabilities of public Clouds for hosting their
application services. In parallel, research in academia has been investigating
transversal aspects such as security, software frameworks, quality of service,
and standardization. We believe that the complete realization of the Cloud
computing vision will lead to the introduction of a virtual market where Cloud
brokers, on behalf of end users, are in charge of selecting and composing the
services advertised by different Cloud vendors. In order to make this happen,
existing solutions and technologies have to be redesigned and extended from a
market-oriented perspective and integrated together, giving rise to what we
term Market-Oriented Cloud Computing.
  In this paper, we will assess the current status of Cloud computing by
providing a reference model, discuss the challenges that researchers and IT
practitioners are facing and will encounter in the near future, and present the
approach for solving them from the perspective of the Cloudbus toolkit, which
comprises of a set of technologies geared towards the realization of Market

market-oriented resource provisioning and brokering within a Cloud and across
multiple distributed resources. We also include an application illustrating the

21 cm observations. We consider multi-frequency interferometer observations. We
assume that the 21 cm signals in different frequency channels are uncorrelated
and the foreground signals change slowly as a function of frequency. When we
add the visibilities of all channels, the foreground signals increase roughly
by a factor of ~N because they are highly correlated. However, the 21 cm
signals increase by a factor of ~\sqrt{N} because the signals in different
channels contribute randomly. This enables us to obtain an accurate shape of
the foreground angular power spectrum. Then, we obtain the 21-cm power spectrum
by subtracting the foreground power spectrum obtained this way. We describe how
to obtain the average power spectrum of the 21 cm signal.

infinite mean, ancestral lineages might not merge at all with positive
probability. Further, we present a construction of the forward in time process

as an impurity or a non-adiabatic contact is studied theoretically. New regime
of conduction in correlated 1D systems is predicted beyond the well-known
regime of tunneling resulting in the power-law I-V-curves. In this regime a
quantum wire becomes ""opened"" at voltage biases above the threshold value
$V_T$, giving rise to a rapid increase of the dc current, $\bar I$, accompanied
by ac oscillations of frequency $f = \bar I/e$. The effect of ac generation is
related to sliding of the Friedel oscillations of electronic density produced
by the defect. Manifestations of the effect resemble the Coulomb blockade and
the Josephson effect. The spin bias applied to the system is shown to affect
the I-V curves due to violation of the spin-charge separation at the defect
site. In short quantum wires of length $L < L_0 \sim \hbar v_F/eV_T$ and at
high temperatures $T > T_0 \sim eV_T/k_B$ the effect is destroyed by
fluctuations. The threshold voltage $V_T$ is determined by $2k_F$-component of
impurity potential renormalized by fluctuations. The 1D conductor is described
in terms of the Tomonaga-Luttinger Hamiltonian with short range or long-range
Coulomb interaction by means of the bosonization technique. We derive boundary
conditions that take into account relaxation in the leads and permit to solve
non-equilibrium problems. Charge fluctuations are studied by means of Gaussian
model which can be justified strictly in the limit of large voltages or strong
enough inter-electronic repulsion. Spin fluctuations are taken into account
strictly by means of the refermionization technique applicable in case of
spin-rotation invariant interaction.

of two quaternions and which can be treated as an octonion. The octonion
possesses the triality symmetry, which defines symmetry of fermion spinors and
bosonic vector fields.
  The triality symmetry relates three sets of spinors and two sets of vectors,
which are transformed among themselves via transformations $G_{23}, G_{12},
G_{13}$, $G_{123}$ and $G_{132}$. If the electromagnetic (EM) interaction is
sensitive to the triality symmetry, i.e. EM probe selects one triality sector,
EM signals from the 5 transformed world would not be detected, and be treated
as the dark matter. According to an astrophysical measurement, the ratio of the
dark to ordinary matter in the universe as a whole is almost exactly 5. We
expect quarks are insensitive to the triality, and triality will appear as
three times larger flavor degrees of freedom in the lattice simulation.

quantum computation for them such that the client's input, output and
computation remain private. A desirable property for any BQC protocol is
verification, whereby the client can verify with high probability whether the
server has followed the instructions of the protocol, or if there has been some
deviation resulting in a corrupted output state. A verifiable BQC protocol can
be viewed as an interactive proof system leading to consequences for complexity
theory. The authors, together with Broadbent, previously proposed a universal
and unconditionally secure BQC scheme where the client only needs to be able to
prepare single qubits in separable states randomly chosen from a finite set and
send them to the server, who has the balance of the required quantum
computational resources. In this paper we extend that protocol with new
functionality allowing blind computational basis measurements, which we use to
construct a new verifiable BQC protocol based on a new class of resource
states. We rigorously prove that the probability of failing to detect an
incorrect output is exponentially small in a security parameter, while resource
overhead remains polynomial in this parameter. The new resource state allows
entangling gates to be performed between arbitrary pairs of logical qubits with
only constant overhead. This is a significant improvement on the original
scheme, which required that all computations to be performed must first be put
into a nearest neighbour form, incurring linear overhead in the number of
qubits. Such an improvement has important consequences for efficiency and
fault-tolerance thresholds.

bounds in various norms. The present note provides a prediction bound based on

appending such a random matrix (with the right number of columns) to a given

using weak Hamiltonian and nuclear properties of initial and excited states are
obtained with relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov model and relativistic

  Aims. Our goal is to analyse and interpret the pulsational behaviour of the
B3 IV star HD 43317 using the CoRoT light curve along with the ground-based
spectroscopy gathered by the Harps instrument. This way we continue our efforts
to map the Beta Cep and SPB instability strips.
  Methods. We used different techniques to reveal the abundances and
fundamental stellar parameters from the newly-obtained high-resolution spectra.
We used various time-series analysis tools to explore the nature of variations
present in the light curve. We calculated the moments and used the
pixel-by-pixel method to look for line profile variations in the
high-resolution spectra.
  Results. We find that HD 43317 is a single fast rotator (v_rot ~ 50% v_crit)
and hybrid SPB/Beta Cep-type pulsator with Solar metal abundances. We interpret
the variations in photometry and spectroscopy as a result of rotational
modulation connected to surface inhomogeneities, combined with the presence of
both g and p mode pulsations. We detect a series of ten consecutive frequencies
with an almost constant period spacing of 6339 s as well as a second shorter
sequence consisting of seven frequencies with a spacing of 6380 s. The dominant
frequencies fall in the regime of gravito-inertial modes.

result of Jespers, Parmenter and Sehgal showing that the Bass units generate a
subgroup of finite index in the center $\mathcal{Z} (\U (\Z G))$ of the unit
group $\U (\Z G)$ in case $G$ is a finite nilpotent group. Next, we give a new
construction of units that generate a subgroup of finite index in
$\mathcal{Z}(\U(\Z G))$ for all finite strongly monomial groups $G$. We call
these units generalized Bass units. Finally, we show that the commutator group
$\U(\Z G)/\U(\Z G)'$ and $\mathcal{Z}(\U(\Z G))$ have the same rank if $G$ is a
finite group such that $\Q G$ has no epimorphic image which is either a
non-commutative division algebra other than a totally definite quaternion
algebra, or a two-by-two matrix algebra over a division algebra with center

to prove that in this case the natural images of the Bass units of $\Z G$

recognized that direct small area survey estimates are highly unreliable owing
to large standard errors and coefficients of variation. The reason behind this
is that a survey is usually designed to achieve a specified level of accuracy
at a higher level of geography than that of small areas. Lack of additional
resources makes it almost imperative to use the same data to produce small area
estimates. For example, if a survey is designed to estimate per capita income
for a state, the same survey data need to be used to produce similar estimates
for counties, subcounties and census divisions within that state. Thus, by
necessity, small area estimation needs explicit, or at least implicit, use of
models to link these areas. Improved small area estimates are found by
""borrowing strength"" from similar neighboring areas.

One of the reasons is the complex crystal structure of most of these materials.
An exception are the infinite layer (IL) compounds consisting essentially of
CuO2 planes. Unfortunately, these materials are difficult to grow and, thus,
there are only few experimental investigations. Recently, we succeeded in
depositing high quality films of the electron doped IL compound Sr1-xLaxCuO2

fluctuations whose distributions cannot explicitly depend on position otherwise
vacuum's small-scale quantum structure would fail to be statistically
homogeneous. Since the collection of fluctuations is a many-body system, the
natural explanation for their position-independent statistics is that they are
in equilibrium with each other and distributed at maximum entropy.
Consequently, their probability distributions obey the laws of statistical
physics which enforces small-scale smoothness, prevents the
homogeneity-violating diffusion found in any free quantum system, and maintains
decoherence. Their entropy, calculated using the explicitly-constructed phase
space of the Riemann whose statistics are derived using a
background-independent graviton exchange ensemble, is proportional to the
Einstein-Hilbert action evaluated on the macroscopic expected geometry and
includes a small, positive cosmological constant. Entropy maximization yields
quantum spacetime's Ehrenfest equations of motion which are identical to
Einstein's expectation-valued field equations. This background-independent
dynamical formulation reveals curvature fluctuation entropy as a source of
expansion and raises the possibility that matter's zero-point energy problem,
which is action-based and not energy shift invariant, may not be a problem
after all.

good fits to the following features: solar luminosity and radius at the solar
age, main-sequence width, red-giant and red-supergiant (RSG) positions in the
HRD, surface abundances, and rotational velocities. Rotating stellar models
predict that about half of the observed WR stars and at least half of the type
Ibc SNe may be produced through the single-star evolution channel. Rotation
increases the duration of the WNL and WNC phases, while reducing those of the
WNE and WC phases, as was already shown in previous works. Rotation increases
the frequency of type Ic SNe. The upper mass limit for type II-P SNe is \sim
19.0 MSun for the non rotating models and \sim 16.8 MSun for the rotating ones.
Both values agree with observations. Moreover, present rotating models provide
a very good fit to the progenitor of SN 2008ax. We discuss future directions of
research for further improving the agreement between the models and the
observations. We conclude that the mass-loss rates in the WNL and RSG phases
are probably underestimated at present. We show that up to an initial mass of
40 M\odot, a surface magnetic field inferior to about 200 G may be sufficient
to produce some braking. Much lower values are needed at the red supergiant
stage. We suggest that the presence/absence of any magnetic braking effect may
play a key role in questions regarding rotation rates of young pulsars and the

branch as a path of the chemical system deviation from its isolated

and reverse reactions in the same chemical system, full thermodynamic branch is
presented by an S-shaped curve, whose ends asymptotically achieve appropriate
initial states, which, in turn, are logistic ends of the opposite reactions.
The slope tangents of the steepest parts of the curves, the areas of the
maximum rate of the shift growth vs. the external thermodynamic force, occurred
to be directly proportional to the force and, simultaneously, linearly
proportional to the thermodynamic equivalent of chemical reaction, which is the
ratio between the amount in moles of any reaction participant, transformed in
an isolated system, along the reaction way from its initial state to
thermodynamic equilibrium, to its stoichiometric coefficient. The found
linearity is valid for arbitrary combination of the stoichiometric coefficients
in a reaction of compound synthesis from chemical elements like aA+bB=AaBb, and
confirms the exclusive role of the thermodynamic equivalent of transformation
as the chemical system characteristic of robustness and irreversibility.
Results of this work allow for quantitative evaluation of the chemical system
shift from thermodynamic equilibrium along thermodynamic branch and its rate

retrograde), or highly inclined orbits near the Lidov-Kozai equilibrium points,
i = 44^{\circ} or i = 137^{\circ} . Among coplanar orbits, the retrograde ones
appear to be less chaotic, while for the orbits near the Lidov-Kozai
equilibria, those around \omega= 270^{\circ} are more reliable, where \omega_k
is the argument of pericenter of the planet's orbit with respect to the
binary's orbit.

at a high precision level. Most predictions about them have until now been
biased on algorithms yielding the expected linear and non-linear spectrum of
density fluctuations. Even when simulations have been used, so-called Halofit
(Smith et al 2003) predictions on fairly large scales have been needed. We wish
to go beyond this limitation. We perform N-body and hydrodynamical simulations
within a sufficiently large cosmological volume to allow a direct connection
between simulations and linear spectra. While covering large length-scales, the
simulation resolution is good enough to allow us to explore the high-l
harmonics of the cosmic shear (up to l ~ 50000), well into the domain where
baryon physics becomes important. We then compare shear spectra in the absence
and in presence of various kinds of baryon physics, such as radiative cooling,
star formation, and supernova feedback in the form of galactic winds. We
distinguish several typical properties of matter fluctuation spectra in the
different simulations and test their impact on shear spectra. We compare our
outputs with those obtainable using approximate expressions for non--linear
spectra, and identify substantial discrepancies even between our results and
those of purely N-body results. Our simulations and the treatment of their
outputs however enable us, for the first time, to obtain shear results taht are
fully independent of any approximate expression, also in the high-l range,
where we need to incorporate a non-linear power spectrum of density
perturbations, and the effects of baryon physics. This will allow us to fully
exploit the cosmological information contained in future high--sensitivity
cosmic shear surveys, exploring the physics of cosmic shears via weak lensing
measurements.

the infrared emission in the Spitzer images, drives a bipolar outflow extending
in the northwest-southeast direction, and is classified as a low luminosity
Class0/I transition object (L_bol ~ 0.5 L_sun). The southeastern continuum
source, referred to as CB17 MMS, has faint dust continuum emission in the SMA
1.3mm observations (about 6 sigma detection; ~3.8 mJy), but is not detected in
the deep Spitzer infrared images at wavelengths from 3.6 to 70 micron. Its
bolometric luminosity and temperature, estimated from its spectral energy
distribution, are less than 0.04 L_sun and 16 K, respectively. The SMA CO(2-1)
observations suggest that CB17 MMS may drive a low-velocity molecular outflow
(about 2.5 km/s), extending in the east-west direction. Comparisons with
prestellar cores and Class0 protostars suggest that CB17 MMS is more evolved
than prestellar cores but less evolved than Class0 protostars. The observed
characteristics of CB17 MMS are consistent with the theoretical predictions
from radiative/magneto hydrodynamical simulations of a first hydrostatic core,
but there is also the possibility that CB17 MMS is an extremely low luminosity
protostar deeply embedded in an edge-on circumstellar disk. Further
observations are needed to study the properties of CB17 MMS and to address more
precisely its evolutionary stage.

text is spell-checked using Bing's spelling suggestion technology to detect and
correct misrecognized words. More specifically, the proposed algorithm breaks
down the ASR output text into several word-tokens that are submitted as search
queries to Bing search engine. A returned spelling suggestion implies that a
query is misspelled; and thus it is replaced by the suggested correction;
otherwise, no correction is performed and the algorithm continues with the next
token until all tokens get validated. Experiments carried out on various
speeches in different languages indicated a successful decrease in the number
of ASR errors and an improvement in the overall error correction rate. Future
research can improve upon the proposed algorithm so much so that it can be
parallelized to take advantage of multiprocessor computers.

The properties of dust grains, in particular their size
distribution, are expected to differ from the interstellar medium to the
high-density regions within molecular clouds. Since the extinction at
near-infrared wavelengths is caused by dust, the extinction law in cores should
depart from that found in low-density environments if the dust grains have
different properties. Aims. We explore methods to measure the near-infrared
extinction law produced by dense material in molecular cloud cores from
photometric data. Methods. Using controlled sets of synthetic and
semi-synthetic data, we test several methods for linear regression applied to
the specific problem of deriving the extinction law from photometric data. We
cover the parameter space appropriate to this type of observations. Results. We
find that many of the common linear-regression methods produce biased results
when applied to the extinction law from photometric colors. We propose and
validate a new method, LinES, as the most reliable for this effect. We explore
the use of this method to detect whether or not the extinction law of a given

species (C2H, c-C3H2, N2H+, NH2D) obtained with the Combined Array for Research
in Millimetre-wave Astronomy, as well as 1.3 cm continuum and NH3 observations

an ultracompact HII region associated with a young B2 zero-age main sequence
(ZAMS) star. The dense gas surrounding the cavity is distributed in a filament
that seems squeezed in between the cavity and a collimated outflow associated
with an intermediate-mass protostar. We have identified 5 millimeter continuum
condensations in the filament. All of them show column densities consistent
with potentially being the birthplace of intermediate- to high-mass objects.
These cores appear different from those observed in low-mass clustered
environments in sereval observational aspects (kinematics, temperature,
chemical gradients), indicating a strong influence of the most massive and
evolved members of the protocluster. We suggest a possible scenario in which
the B2 ZAMS star driving the cavity has compressed the surrounding gas,
perturbed its properties and induced the star formation in its immediate
surroundings.

organizations have been investing in Information Technology to automate their
internal processes to cut costs and efficiently support their business
projects. However, this comes to a price. Business requirements always change.
Likewise, IT systems constantly evolves as developers make new versions of
them, which require endless administrative manual work to customize and
configure them, especially if they are being used in different contexts, by
different types of users, and for different requirements. Autonomic computing
was conceived to provide an answer to these ever-changing requirements.
Essentially, autonomic systems are self-configuring, self-healing,
self-optimizing, and self-protecting; hence, they can automate all complex IT
processes without human intervention. This paper proposes an autonomic model
based on Venn diagram and set theory for self-configuring C#.NET applications,
namely the self-customization of their GUI, event-handlers, and security
permissions. The proposed model does not require altering the source-code of
the original application; rather, it uses an XML-based customization file to
turn on and off the internal attributes of the application. Experiments
conducted on the proposed model, showed a successful automatic customization
for C# applications and an effective self-adaption based on dynamic business
requirements. As future work, other programming languages such as Java and C++
are to be supported, in addition to other operating systems such as Linux and
Mac so as to provide a standard platform-independent autonomic self-configuring
model.

flux arising due to Ekman friction. We derive an expression for the enstrophy
flux which exhibits a logarithmic dependence in the inertial range for the
Ekman-friction dominated flows. The energy spectrum obtained using this

individuals often give rise to self-organized collective organizations that
offer functional benefits to the group. For instance, flows of pedestrians
moving in opposite directions spontaneously segregate into lanes of uniform
walking directions. This phenomenon is often referred to as a smart collective
pattern, as it increases the traffic efficiency with no need of external
control. However, the functional benefits of this emergent organization have
never been experimentally measured, and the underlying behavioral mechanisms
are poorly understood. In this work, we have studied this phenomenon under
controlled laboratory conditions. We found that the traffic segregation
exhibits structural instabilities characterized by the alternation of organized
and disorganized states, where the lifetime of well-organized clusters of
pedestrians follow a stretched exponential relaxation process. Further analysis
show that the inter-pedestrian variability of comfortable walking speeds is a
key variable at the origin of the observed traffic perturbations. We show that
the collective benefit of the emerging pattern is maximized when all
pedestrians walk at the average speed of the group. In practice, however, local
interactions between slow- and fast-walking pedestrians trigger global
breakdowns of organization, which reduce the collective and the individual
payoff provided by the traffic segregation. This work is a step ahead toward
the understanding of traffic self-organization in crowds, which turns out to be
modulated by complex behavioral mechanisms that do not always maximize the
group's benefits. The quantitative understanding of crowd behaviors opens the
way for designing bottom-up management strategies bound to promote the
emergence of efficient collective behaviors in crowds.

typical of the high-redshift universe. Here we therefore provide accurate data

Haro 11 and ESO 338-IG 004. On the basis of Very Large Telescope/X-shooter
spectroscopic observations in the wavelength range 3000-24000\AA, we use
standard direct methods to derive physical conditions and element abundances.
Furthermore, we use X-shooter data together with Spitzer observations in the
mid-infrared range to attempt to find hidden star formation. We derive
interstellar oxygen abundances of 12 + log O/H = 8.33+/-0.01, 8.10+/-0.04, and
7.89+/-0.01 in the two HII regions B and C of Haro 11 and in ESO 338-IG 004,
respectively. The observed fluxes of the hydrogen lines correspond to the
theoretical recombination values after correction for extinction with a single
value of the extinction coefficient C(Hbeta) across the entire wavelength range
from the near-ultraviolet to the NIR and mid-infrared for each of the studied
HII regions. Therefore there are no emission-line regions contributing to the
line emission in the NIR range, which are hidden in the optical range. The
agreement between the extinction-corrected and CLOUDY-predicted fluxes implies
that a HII region model including only stellar photoionisation is able to
account for the observed fluxes, in both the optical and NIR ranges. All
observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can be reproduced quite well
across the whole wavelength range by model SEDs except for Haro 11B, where
there is a continuum flux excess at wavelengths >1.6mum. It is possible that
one or more red supergiant stars are responsible for the NIR flux excess in
Haro 11B. We find evidence of a luminous blue variable (LBV) star in Haro 11C.

abrupt variable and to have a circumstellar disk with very active accretion.
Our monitoring observations in 2009-2011 revealed the star to show sporadic
flare events, each with brightening of < 0.5 mag lasting for days. These
brightening events, associated with a color change toward the blue, should
originate from an increased accretion activity. Moreover, the star also
underwent a brightness drop of ~1 mag lasting for about a month, during which
the star became bluer when fainter. Such brightness drops seem to have a
recurrence time scale of a year, as evidenced in our data and the photometric
behavior of GM Cep over a century. Between consecutive drops, the star
brightened gradually by about 1 mag and became blue at peak luminosity. We
propose that the drop is caused by obscuration of the central star by an
orbiting dust concentration. The UX Orionis type of activity in GM Cep
therefore exemplifies the disk inhomogeneity process in transition between
grain coagulation and planetesimal formation in a young circumstellar disk.

association, it is a star with a well-determined age of 16 Myr. Twelve new
spectra obtained from the FEROS, ESPaDOnS, and HARPS instruments, provide
sufficient material from which to re-evaluate the magnetic field and obtain a
first approximation to the atmospheric abundance distributions of various
elements. Using the new magnetic field measurements and optical photometry
together with previously published data, we refine the period of HD 133880 to P
= 0.877476 \pm 0.000009 days. The magnetic field structure was characterised by
a colinear multipole expansion from the observed variations of the longitudinal
and surface fields with rotational phase. This simple axisymmetric magnetic
field model is based on a predominantly quadrupolar component that roughly
describes the field variations. Using spectrum synthesis, we derived mean
abundances for O, Mg, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, Nd and Pr. All elements, except Mg (which
has a uniform distribution), are overabundant compared to the Sun and are more
abundant in the negative than in the positive magnetic hemisphere. In contrast
to most Bp stars the abundance of O in HD 133880 is overabundant compared to
the solar abundance ratio. In studying the Halpha and Paschen lines in the
optical spectra we could not unambiguously detect information about the
magnetosphere of HD 133880. However, radio emission data at both 3 and 6 cm
suggests that the magnetospheric plasma is held in rigid rotation with the star
by the magnetic field and further supported against collapse by the rapid
rotation. Subtle differences in the shapes of the optically thick radio light
curves at 3 and 6 cm suggest that the large-scale magnetic field is not fully
axisymmetric at large distances from the star.

demonstrate that if nucleons are the only degrees of freedom of nuclear wave
function, the structure function of a nucleus would be the additive sum of the
nucleon distributions at the same Bjorken x = AQ^2/2(p_Aq)< 0.5 up to very
small Fermi motion corrections if x>0.05. Thus the difference of the EMC ratio
from one reveals the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom in nuclei.
Using exact QCD sum rules we show that the ratio R_A(x_p,Q^2) used in
experimental studies, where x_p = Q^2/2q_0 m_p deviates from one even if a
nucleus consists of nucleons with small momenta only. Use of the Bjorken x
leads to additional decrease of R_A(x,Q^2) as compared to the x_p plots.
Coherent contribution of equivalent photons into photon component of parton
wave function of a nucleus unambiguously follows from Lorentz transformation of
the rest frame nucleus Coulomb field. For A~200 photons carry ~0.0065 fraction
of the light momentum of nucleus almost compensates the difference between data
analysis in terms of Bjorken x and x_p. Different role of higher twist effects
for Q^2 probed at electron and muon beams is emphasized. Direct observations of
large and predominantly nucleonic short-range correlations in nuclei pose a
serious challenge for most of the models of the EMC effect for x>0.6. The data
are consistent with a scenario in which the hadronic EMC effect reflects
fluctuations of inter nucleon interaction due to fluctuations of color
distribution in the interacting nucleons. The dynamic realization of this
scenario is the model in which the 3q (3qg) configurations with x > 0.5 parton
have a weaker interaction with nearby nucleons, leading to suppression of such
configurations giving a right magnitude of the EMC effect. The directions for
the future studies and challenging questions are outlined.

Facebook as a stakeholder engagement tool. We find that there are 5 primary
categories of Facebook ""statuses"", which can be aggregated into three key
dimensions - ""information"", ""community"", and ""action"". Our analysis reveals
that, though the ""informational"" use of Facebook is still significant,
nonprofit organizations are better at using Facebook to strategically engage
their stakeholders via ""dialogic"" and ""community-building"" practices than they
have been with traditional websites. The adoption of social media seems to have
engendered new paradigms of public engagement.

higher redshifts using the semi-analytic galaxy formation models of Fu et al.
(2010) in which we track the surface density profiles of gas in disks. We adopt
two different prescriptions based either on gas surface density and
metallicity, or on interstellar pressure, to compute the molecular fraction as
a function of radius in each disk. We demonstrate that the adopted star
formation law determines how the {\em balance} between gas, stars and metals
changes with time in the star-forming galaxy population, but does not influence
the total mass in stars formed into galaxies at redshifts below $z\sim 2.5$.
The redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation places strong
constraints on the timescale over which cold gas is converted into stars in
high redshift galaxies, and favours models where this remains constant at
values around 1-2 Gyr. Future observations of the evolution of the average
molecular-to-atomic gas ratio in galaxies as a function of stellar mass and
redshift will constrain models of the atomic-to-molecular transition.

newly measured beta-decay half-lives is an enhancement in the calculated
abundance of isotopes with mass number A = 110 -- 120 relative to calculated
abundances based upon beta-decay rates estimated with the finite-range droplet

B-mode polarization experiments to constrain the primordial tensor-to-scalar
ratio, r. To clean the foreground contributions we use parametric, maximum
likelihood component separation technique, and consider experimental setups
optimized to render a minimal level of the foreground residuals in the
recovered CMB map. We consider nearly full-sky observations, include two
diffuse foreground components, dust and synchrotron, and study cases with and
without calibration errors, spatial variability of the foreground properties,
and partial or complete B-mode lensing signal removal.
  In all these cases we find that in the limit of very low noise level and in
the absence of the intrumental or modeling systematic effects, the foreground
residuals do not lead to a limit on the lowest detectable value of r. But the
need to control the foreground residuals will play a major role in determining
the minimal noise levels necessary to permit a robust detection of r < 0.1 and
therefore in optimizing and forecasting the performance of the future missions.
For current and proposed experiments noise levels, the foreground residuals are
found non-negligible and potentially can affect our ability to set constraints
on r. We also show how the constraints can be significantly improved on by
restricting the post component separation processing to a smaller sky area.
This procedure applied to a case of a COrE-like satellite mission is shown to
result potentially in over an order of magnitude improvement in the detectable
value of r. With sufficient knowledge of the experimental bandpasses as well as
foreground component scaling laws, our conclusions are found to be independent
on the assumed overall normalization of the foregrounds and only quantitatively
depend on specific parametrizations assumed for the foreground components.

of $X$ up to homeomorphism. This circumstance gives the top homology the
structure of an (orientable) matroid, where cycles in the sense of matroids
correspond to the cycles in the sense of homology. This adds a novel
topological invariant to the topological literature.

candidates are computationally searched from pre-filtered catalogue data using
a method that fits a mixture model of Gaussian densities and background noise
using the Expectation Maximization algorithm. The catalogue data contains a
significant number of false sources clustered around bright stars. A large
fraction of these artefacts were automatically filtered out before or during
the cluster search. The UKIDSS data reduction pipeline tends to classify
marginally resolved stellar pairs and objects seen against variable surface
brightness as extended objects (or ""galaxies"" in the archive parlance). 10% or
66 x 10^6 of the sources in the UKIDSS GPS catalogue brighter than 17
magnitudes in the K band are classified as ""galaxies"". Young embedded clusters
create variable NIR surface brightness because the gas/dust clouds in which

appear therefore as clusters of ""galaxies"" in the catalogue and can be found

vanishing circular polarisation for such quasars is an important problem for a
mechanism involving the mixing with axion-like particles in external magnetic
fields. In this note, we stress that a recent report of similar coherent
orientations of polarisation in radiowaves further disfavours the need for such
particles, as an effect at these wavelengths would be extremely suppressed or

2.2<z<2.8 using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We use a
homogeneous subset of the data consisting of 27,129 quasars with spectroscopic
redshifts---by far the largest such sample used for clustering measurements at
these redshifts to date. The sample covers 3,600 square degrees, corresponding
to a comoving volume of 9.7(Gpc/h)^3 assuming a fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology,
and it has a median absolute i-band magnitude of -26, k-corrected to z=2. After
accounting for redshift errors we find that the redshift space correlation
function is fit well by a power-law of slope -2 and amplitude s_0=(9.7\pm
0.5)Mpc/h over the range 3<s<25Mpc/h. The projected correlation function, which
integrates out the effects of peculiar velocities and redshift errors, is fit
well by a power-law of slope -1 and r_0=(8.4\pm 0.6)Mpc/h over the range
4<R<16Mpc/h. There is no evidence for strong luminosity or redshift dependence
to the clustering amplitude, in part because of the limited dynamic range in
our sample. Our results are consistent with, but more precise than, previous
measurements at similar redshifts. Our measurement of the quasar clustering
amplitude implies a bias factor of b~3.5 for our quasar sample. We compare the
data to models to constrain the manner in which quasars occupy dark matter

the renormalization scale and take an arbitrary range to estimate the
uncertainty in the QCD prediction. However, predictions using this procedure
depend on the renormalization scheme, leave a non-convergent renormalon
perturbative series, and moreover, one obtains incorrect results when applied
to QED processes. In contrast, if one fixes the renormalization scale using the
Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC), all non-conformal $\{\beta_i\}$-terms
in the perturbative expansion series are summed into the running coupling, and
one obtains a unique, scale-fixed, scheme-independent prediction at any finite
order. The PMC scale $\mu^{\rm PMC}_R$ and the resulting finite-order PMC
prediction are both to high accuracy independent of the choice of initial
renormalization scale $\mu^{\rm init}_R$, consistent with renormalization group
invariance. As an application, we apply the PMC procedure to obtain NNLO
predictions for the $t\bar{t}$-pair production at the Tevatron and LHC
colliders. The PMC prediction for the total cross-section $\sigma_{t\bar{t}}$
agrees well with the present Tevatron and LHC data. We also verify that the
initial scale-independence of the PMC prediction is satisfied to high accuracy
at the NNLO level: the total cross-section remains almost unchanged even when
taking very disparate initial scales $\mu^{\rm init}_R$ equal to $m_t$,
$20\,m_t$, $\sqrt{s}$. Moreover, after PMC scale setting, we obtain
$A_{FB}^{t\bar{t}} \simeq 12.5%$, $A_{FB}^{p\bar{p}} \simeq 8.28%$ and
$A_{FB}^{t\bar{t}}(M_{t\bar{t}}>450 \;{\rm GeV}) \simeq 35.0%$. These
predictions have a $1\,\sigma$-deviation from the present CDF and D0
measurements; the large discrepancy of the top quark forward-backward asymmetry
between the Standard Model estimate and the data are thus greatly reduced.

characteristics at and below the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition,

integrating the renormalization group flow equations up to a scale where they
can be reliably matched to simple analytic expressions. The vortex fugacity
turns out to be dangerously irrelevant for these quantities below Tc, thereby
altering the scaling behavior. We derive the possible crossover effects as the
current, magnetic field, or system size is varied, and find a strong
multiplicative logarithmic correction near Tc, all of which is necessary to
account for when interpreting experiments and simulation data. Our analysis
clarifies a longstanding discrepancy between the finite size dependence found
in many simulations and the current-voltage characteristics of experiments. We
further show that the logarithmic correction can be avoided by approaching the
transition in a magnetic field, thereby simplifying the scaling analysis. We
confirm our results by large-scale numerical simulations, and calculate the

  Linearized Polynomials","This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to incorrect
  statements",,,,cs.IT math.IT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  In this paper, we propose two new constructions of exact-repair minimum
storage regenerating (exact-MBR) codes. Both constructions obtain the encoded
symbols by first treating the message vector over GF(q) as a linearized
polynomial and then evaluating it over an extension field GF(q^m). The
evaluation points are chosen so that the encoded symbols at any node are
conjugates of each other, while corresponding symbols of different nodes are
linearly dependent with respect to GF(q). These properties ensure that data
repair can be carried out over the base field GF(q), instead of matrix
inversion over the extension field required by some existing exact-MBR codes.
To the best of our knowledge, this approach is novel in the construction of
exact-MBR codes. One of our constructions leads to exact-MBR codes with
arbitrary parameters. These exact-MBR codes have higher data reconstruction
complexities but lower data repair complexities than their counterparts based
on the product-matrix approach; hence they may be suitable for applications
that need a small number of data reconstructions but a large number of data
repairs.

barred galaxies with a broad distribution of Hubble types in order to have a
first estimate of the magnitude of their secular mass accretion/excretion rates
in the context of bulge building and morphological evolution along the Hubble
sequence. The stellar surface density maps of the sample galaxies were derived
from the archival data of SINGS and SDSS. The corresponding molecular and
atomic surface densities were derived from archival CO(1-0) and HI
interferometric observations of the BIMA SONG, THINGS, and VIVA surveys. The
method used for determining the radial mass flow rates follows from our
previous work using the potential-density phase shift approach, which utilizes
a volume-type torque integral to calculate the angular momentum exchange rate
between the basic state disk matter and the density wave modes. This approach
yields radial mass flow rates and angular momentum transport rates several
times higher than similar rates estimated using the traditional method of
gravitational torque couple of Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs 1972, and this
difference reflects the dominant role played by collisionless shocks in the
secular evolution of galaxies containing extremely non-linear, quasi-steady
density wave modes. It is shown that these non-linear modes maintains their
quasi-steady state at the expense of a continuous radial mass flow and the
resulting morphological transformation of galaxies throughout their lifetime,
not only for late-type and intermediate-type disk galaxies but, under favorable
conditions, also for earlier types including S0s and disky ellipticals. We show
here for the first time using observational data that stellar mass
accretion/excretion is just as important, and oftentimes much more important,
than the corresponding accretion/excretion processes in the gaseous component.

structure on the galaxy correlation function. We base our analysis on the
galaxy formation models of Guo et al., run on the Millennium Simulations. We
quantify the importance of these effects by randomizing the angular positions
of satellite galaxies within haloes, either coherently or individually, while
keeping the distance to their respective central galaxies fixed. We find that
the effect of disrupting the alignment with larger scale structure is a ~2 per
cent decrease in the galaxy correlation function around r=1.8 Mpc/h. We find
that sphericalizing the ellipsoidal distributions of galaxies within haloes
decreases the correlation function by up to 20 per cent for r<1 Mpc/h and
increases it slightly at somewhat larger radii. Similar results apply to power
spectra and redshift-space correlation functions. Models based on the Halo
Occupation Distribution, which place galaxies spherically within haloes
according to a mean radial profile, will therefore significantly underestimate
the clustering on sub-Mpc scales. In addition, we find that halo assembly bias,
in particular the dependence of clustering on halo shape, propagates to the
clustering of galaxies. We predict that this aspect of assembly bias should be
observable through the use of extensive group catalogues.

the presence and distribution of X-ray AGN in the large-scale structure
environments of 22 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.9 < z
\lesssim 1.6 compiled by the XMM-Newton Distant Cluster Project (XDCP). To this
end, the X-ray point source lists from detections in the soft-band (0.35-2.4
keV) and full-band (0.3-7.5 keV) were stacked in cluster-centric coordinates
and compared to average background number counts extracted from three
independent control fields in the same observations. A significant full-band
(soft-band) excess of \sim78 (67) X-ray point sources is found in the cluster
fields within an angular distance of 8' (4Mpc) at a statistical confidence
level of 4.0 sigma (4.2 sigma), corresponding to an average number of detected
excess AGN per cluster environment of 3.5\pm0.9 (3.0\pm0.7). The data point
towards a rising radial profile in the cluster region (r<1Mpc) of predominantly
low-luminosity AGN with an average detected excess of about one point source
per system, with a tentative preferred occurrence along the main cluster
elongation axis. A second statistically significant overdensity of brighter
soft-band detected AGN is found at cluster-centric distances of 4'-6' (2-3Mpc),
corresponding to about three times the average cluster radius R200 of the
systems. If confirmed, these results would support the idea of two different
physical triggering mechanisms of X-ray AGN activity in dependence of the
radially changing large-scale structure environment of the distant clusters.

the largest cosmological N-body simulations carried out to date 3x10^11
particles within a cube of volume ~70Gpc^3). This allows us to investigate the
cosmological parameter dependence of the mass and evolution of haloes in the
extreme high-mass tail of the z=6 distribution. We assume these objects to be
likely hosts for the population of rare but ultraluminous high-redshift quasars
discovered by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Haloes with a similar abundance to
these quasars have a median mass of 9x10^12 Msun in the currently preferred
cosmology, but do not evolve into equally extreme objects at z=0. Rather, their
descendants span the full range conventionally assigned to present-day
clusters, 6x10^13 to 2.5x10^15 Msun for this same cosmology. The masses both at
z=6 and at z=0 shift up or down by factors exceeding two if cosmological
parameters are pushed to the boundaries of the range discussed in published
interpretations of data from the WMAP satellite. The main factor determining
the future growth of a high-mass z=6 halo is the mean overdensity of its
environment on scales of 7 to 14 Mpc, and descendant masses can be predicted 6
to 8 times more accurately if this density is known than if it is not. All
these features are not unique to extreme high-z haloes, but are generic to
hierarchical growth. Finally, we find that extreme haloes at z=6 typically
acquired about half of their total mass in the preceding 100 Myr, implying very
large recent accretion rates which may be related to the large black hole
masses and high luminosities of the SDSS quasars.

strongly-interacting piece of the Standard Model - are dominated by two
emergent phenomena: confinement; namely, the theory's elementary
degrees-of-freedom - quarks and gluons - have never been detected in isolation;
and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB), which is a remarkably effective
mass generating mechanism, responsible for the mass of more than 98% of visible
matter in the Universe. These phenomena are not apparent in the formulae that
define QCD, yet they play a principal role in determining Nature's observable
characteristics. Much remains to be learnt before confinement can properly be
understood. On the other hand,the last decade has seen important progress in
the use of relativistic quantum field theory, so that we can now explain the
origin of DCSB and are beginning to demonstrate its far-reaching consequences.
Dyson-Schwinger equations have played a critical role in these advances. These
lecture notes provide an introduction to Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs), QCD
and hadron physics, and illustrate the use of DSEs to predict phenomena that
are truly observable.

homogeneous condensates. It turns out, however, that in this regime they are
disfavored against a phase with a one-dimensional modulation of the chiral
condensate. On the other hand, we find that square and hexagonal lattices
eventually get favored at higher chemical potentials. Although stretching the
limits of the model to some extent, this would support predictions from

the Markov transition probabilities from that time point. This allows us to
gauge the influence of each parasite species on the transition probabilities

sampler, which cycles through each of the diseases, first using an adaptive
Metropolis-Hastings step to sample from the conditional posterior of the
covariate parameters for that particular disease given the hidden states for

given the parameters. We find evidence for interactions between several pairs

information from diesel fuel injection events can be obtained using a
forward-scatter imaging geometry, and used to calculate the velocities of
liquid structures on the periphery of the spray. In order to obtain accurate
velocities directly from individual diesel spray structures, those features
need to be spatially resolved in the measurement. The distributed structures
measured in a direct shadowgraphy arrangement cannot be reliably analyzed for
this kind of velocity information. However, by utilizing an intense collimated
light source and adding imaging optics which modify the signal collection,
spatially resolved optical information can be retrieved from spray edge regions
within a chosen object plane. This work discusses a set of measurements where a
diesel spray is illuminated in rapid succession by two ultrafast laser pulses
generated by a mode-locked Ti-Sapphire oscillator seeding a matched pair of
regenerative amplifiers. Light from the object plane, located at the center of
the spray, is directed by a set of imaging optics to the detection plane, where
it forms a shadow image on the face of a frame-transfer CCD. In this
configuration the depth-of-field of the imaging optics limit detected light,
effectively increasing the efficiency of signal collection within the object
plane and suppressing out-of-focus contributions. Time-correlated images are
collected in this manner and analyzed to obtain object plane velocity data for
in-focus edge features of the spray.

representation that may fail to describe the instantaneous and fluctuating

potential, a time invariant function characterizing the agents' interactions
and constructing an activity driven model capable of encoding the instantaneous
time description of the network dynamics. The model provides an explanation of
structural features such as the presence of hubs, which simply originate from
the heterogeneous activity of agents. Within this framework, highly dynamical
networks can be described analytically, allowing a quantitative discussion of
the biases induced by the time-aggregated representations in the analysis of

resource for quantum metrology. In interferometric sensors they allow to
overcome the ""classical"" projection noise limit stemming from the independent
nature of the individual photons or atoms within the interferometer. Motivated
by the potential impact on metrology as wells as by fundamental questions in
the context of entanglement, a lot of theoretical and experimental effort has
been made to study squeezed states. The first squeezed states useful for
quantum enhanced metrology have been proposed and generated in quantum optics,
where the squeezed variables are the coherences of the light field. In this
tutorial we focus on spin squeezing in atomic systems. We give an introduction
to its concepts and discuss its generation in Bose-Einstein condensates. We
discuss in detail the experimental requirements necessary for the generation
and direct detection of coherent spin squeezing. Two exemplary experiments
demonstrating adiabatically prepared spin squeezing based on motional degrees
of freedom and diabatically realized spin squeezing based on internal hyperfine
degrees of freedom are discussed.

line-tied asymmetric magnetic reconnection in the context of solar flare and
coronal mass ejection current sheets. The reconnection process is made
asymmetric along the inflow direction by allowing the initial upstream magnetic
field strengths and densities to differ, and along the outflow direction by
placing the initial perturbation near a conducting wall boundary that
represents the photosphere. When the upstream magnetic fields are asymmetric,
the post-flare loop structure is distorted into a characteristic skewed candle
flame shape. The simulations can thus be used to provide constraints on the
reconnection asymmetry in post-flare loops. More hard X-ray emission is
expected to occur at the footpoint on the weak magnetic field side because
energetic particles are more likely to escape the magnetic mirror there than at
the strong magnetic field footpoint. The footpoint on the weak magnetic field
side is predicted to move more quickly because of the requirement in two
dimensions that equal amounts of flux must be reconnected from each upstream
region. The X-line drifts away from the conducting wall in all simulations with
asymmetric outflow and into the strong magnetic field region during most of the
simulations with asymmetric inflow. There is net plasma flow across the X-line
for both the inflow and outflow directions. The reconnection exhaust directed
away from the obstructing wall is significantly faster than the exhaust
directed towards it. The asymmetric inflow condition allows net vorticity in
the rising outflow plasmoid which would appear as rolling motions about the
flux rope axis.

probing model where $\beta$ fraction of time slot is consumed for acquiring the

joint scheduling and channel probing algorithm named SDF by considering the
overhead of obtaining the channel state information. We first analytically
prove SDF algorithm can support $1+\epsilon$ fraction of of the full rate

expected number of users which are not probed. Then, for homogenous channel, we
show that when the number of users in the network is greater than 3, $\epsilon

heterogenous channels, we prove the conditions under which SDF guarantees to
increase the rate region. We also demonstrate numerically in a realistic
simulation setting that this rate region can be achieved by probing only less
than 50% of all channels in a CDMA based cellular network utilizing high data

the canonical anticommutation relations, $Q_iQ_j+Q_jQ_i = 2\delta_{ij}I$, and
let $\tau$ denote the normalized trace on $\Cl$. This algebra arises in quantum
mechanics as the algebra of observables generated by $n$ Fermionic degrees of

that $\tau(\rho) =1$; these are the non-commutative analogs of probability
densities in the non-commutative probability space $(\Cl,\tau)$. The Fermionic
Fokker-Planck equation is a quantum-mechanical analog of the classical
Fokker-Planck equation with which it has much in common, such as the same
optimal hypercontractivity properties. In this paper we construct a Riemannian
metric on $\Dens$ that we show to be a natural analog of the classical
2-Wasserstein metric, and we show that, in analogy with the classical case, the
Fermionic Fokker-Planck equation is gradient flow in this metric for the
relative entropy with respect to the ground state. We derive a number of
consequences of this, such as a sharp Talagrand inequality for this metric, and
we prove a number of results pertaining to this metric. Several open problems
are raised.

diameter of the graph, and n the number of nodes in the largest component, all
prior map-reduce techniques either require d rounds, or require about n|V| +
|E| communication per round. We propose two randomized map-reduce algorithms --
(i) Hash-Greater-To-Min, which provably requires at most 3log(n) rounds with
high probability, and at most 2(|V| + |E|) communication per round, and (ii)
Hash-to-Min, which has a worse theoretical complexity, but in practice
completes in at most 2log(d) rounds and 3(|V| + |E|) communication per rounds.

paired superradiance, or PSR for short. This is a cooperative process
characterized by two photons back to back emitted with equal energies. By
irradiation of trigger laser from two target ends, with its frequency tuned at
the half energy between two levels, a macroscopically coherent state of medium
and fields dynamically emerges as time evolves and large signal of amplified
output occurs with a time delay. The basic semi-classical equations in 1+1
spacetime dimensions are derived for the field plus medium system to describe
the spacetime evolution of the entire system, and numerically solved to
demonstrate existence of both explosive and weak PSR phenomena in the presence
of relaxation terms. The explosive PSR event terminates accompanying a sudden
release of most energy stored in the target. Our numerical simulations are
performed using a vibrational transition $X^1\Sigma_g^+ v=1 \rightarrow 0$ of
para-H$_2$ molecule, and taking many different excited atom number densities
and different initial coherences between the metastable and the ground states.
In an example of number density close to $O[10^{21}]$cm$^{-3}$ and of high

In this paper, we analyze the time needed to diffuse information throughout a
network when network coding is implemented at all nodes. We then provide an
upper bound for the dissemination time for ad-hoc networks with general
topology. Moreover, we derive a relation between dissemination time and the
size of the wireless network. It is shown that for a wireless network with N
nodes, the dissemination latency is between O(N) and O(N^2), depending on the

for inverse problems based on Gaussian noise on infinite-dimensional Hilbert
space. The covariance operator for the Gaussian noise is assumed to be trace
class, and the Jacobian of the forward operator Hilbert-Schmidt. We show that
the appropriate space for defining the Fisher information is given by the
Cameron-Martin space. This is mainly because the range space of the covariance
operator always is strictly smaller than the Hilbert space. For the Fisher
information to be well-defined, it is furthermore required that the range space
of the Jacobian is contained in the Cameron-Martin space. In order for this
condition to hold and for the Fisher information to be trace class, a
sufficient condition is formulated based on the singular values of the Jacobian
as well as of the eigenvalues of the covariance operator, together with some
regularity assumptions regarding their relative rate of convergence. An
explicit example is given regarding an electromagnetic inverse source problem

uses as input the phase of the form factor below the first inelastic threshold,
known with great precision through the Fermi-Watson theorem from $\pi\pi$

the charge radius and the experimental value at $-2.45 \gev^2$ measured at JLab
considerably increases the strength of the bounds in the region $ Q^2 \lesssim

non-perturbative dynamical control irrespective of the types of environments

there is a threshold and a large pulse parameter region where the effective
dynamical control can be implemented, in contrast to the perturbative
decoupling schemes where the permissible parameters are represented by a point
or converge to a very small subset in the large parameter region admitted by
our non-perturbative approach. An important implication of the non-perturbative
approach is its flexibility in implementing the dynamical control scheme in a
experimental setup. Our findings have exhibited several interesting features of
the non-perturbative regimes such as the chain-size independence, pulse
strength upper-bound, noncontinuous valid parameter regions, etc. Furthermore,
we find that our non-perturbative scheme is robust against randomness in model

potential difference (CPD) signals recorded by KPFM on surfaces of insulating
and semiconducting samples, have stimulated theoretical attempts to explain
such effects. We attack this problem in two steps. First, the electrostatics of
the macroscopic tip-cantilever-sample system is treated by a finite-difference
method on an adjustable nonuniform mesh. Then the resulting electric field
under the tip apex is inserted into a series of atomistic wavelet-based density
functional theory (DFT) calculations. Results are shown for a realistic neutral
but reactive silicon nano-scale tip interacting with a NaCl(001) sample.
Bias-dependent forces and resulting atomic displacements are computed to within
an unprecedented accuracy. Theoretical expressions for amplitude modulation
(AM) and frequency modulation (FM) KPFM signals and for the corresponding local
contact potential differences (LCPD) are obtained by combining the macroscopic
and atomistic contributions to the electrostatic force component generated at
the voltage modulation frequency, and evaluated for several tip oscillation
amplitudes A up to 10 nm. Being essentially constant over a few Volts, the
slope of atomistic force versus bias is the basic quantity which determines
variations of the atomic-scale LCPD contrast. Already above A = 0.1 nm, the
LCPD contrasts in both modes exhibit almost the same spatial dependence as the
slope. In the AM mode, this contrast is approximately proportional to
$A^{-1/2}$, but remains much weaker than the contrast in the FM mode, which
drops somewhat faster as A is increased. These trends are a consequence of the
macroscopic contributions to the KPFM signal, which are stronger in the AM-mode
and especially important if the sample is an insulator even at sub-nanometer
separations where atomic-scale contrast appears.

measurements, monitoring or direct observations of system performances and can
be used to update the system reliability estimate. In structural reliability
analysis, such information is expressed either by inequalities (e.g. for the
observation that no defect is present) or by equalities (e.g. for quantitative
measurements of system characteristics). When information Z is of the equality
type, the a-priori probability of Z is zero and most structural reliability
methods (SRM) are not directly applicable to the computation of the updated
reliability. Hitherto, the computation of the reliability of engineering
systems conditional on equality information was performed through first- and
second order approximations. In this paper, it is shown how equality
information can be transformed into inequality information, which enables
reliability updating by solving a standard structural system reliability
problem. This approach enables the use of any SRM, including those based on
simulation, for reliability updating with equality information. It is
demonstrated on three numerical examples, including an application to fatigue
reliability.

between users and items, our method can pinpoint most relative users and items

pheromone, we capture the evolution of user preference over time. Meanwhile,
the computation complexity is comparatively small and the incremental update
can be done online. We design three experiments on three typical recommender

A simple
example is the classic problem, first considered by Berg and Purcell, of
determining the concentration of a chemical ligand in the surrounding media. On
general theoretical grounds (Landuer's Principle), it is expected that such
computations require cells to consume energy. Here, we explicitly calculate the
energetic costs of computing ligand concentration for a simple two-component
cellular network that implements a noisy version of the Berg-Purcell strategy.
We show that learning about external concentrations necessitates the breaking
of detailed balance and consumption of energy, with greater learning requiring
more energy. Our calculations suggest that the energetic costs of cellular
computation may be an important constraint on networks designed to function in
resource poor environments such as the spore germination networks of bacteria.

be reduced to a simple modification of the Euler-Maruyama method for Brownian
dynamics involving a non-Markovian (coloured noise) random process. In the

achieved. All methods considered are efficient for molecular applications
(requiring one force evaluation per timestep) and of a simple form. In fully

  This work proposes a more rigorous demonstration which leads to the same

the velocity difference in terms of proper stochastic variables which are
adequate to describe the mechanism of kinetic energy cascade.

We analyze the surroundings of HD 97300, one of two intermediate-mass
stars in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. The star is known to be
surrounded by a conspicuous ring of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
  Methods. We present infrared images taken with Herschel and Spitzer using 11
different broad-band filters between 3.6 um and 500 um. We compare the
morphology of the emission using cuts along different position angles. We
construct spectral energy distributions, which we compare to different dust
models, and calculate dust temperatures. We also derive opacity maps and
analyze the density structure of the environment of HD 97300.
  Results. We find that HD 97300 has no infrared excess at or below 24 um,
confirming its zero-age main-sequence nature. The morphology of the ring is
very similar between 3.6 um and 24 um. The emission at these wavelengths is
dominated by either PAH features or PAH continuum. At longer wavelengths, only
the northwestern part of the ring is visible. A fit to the 100-500 um
observations suggests that the emission is due to relatively warm (~26 K) dust.
The temperature gradually decreases with increasing distance from the ring. We
find a general decrease in the density from north to south, and an approximate
10% density increase in the northeastern part of the ring.
  Conclusions. Our results are consistent with the theory that the ring around
HD 97300 is essentially a bubble blown into the surrounding interstellar matter
and heated by the star.

Specifically, the paper proposes a max-weight PEV dispatch algorithm to control
the PEV charging rates, subject to power system physical limits. The proposed
max-weight PEV dispatch algorithm is proved to be throughput optimal under very
mild assumptions on the stochastic dynamics in the system. This suggests that
the costly distribution system infrastructure upgrade can be avoided, or
failing that, at least successfully deferred. The proposed PEV dispatch
algorithm is particularly attractive in integrating the renewable energy

points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, an integer weight $x_p$ associated to each point $p
\in P$, and a range space ${\cal R} \subseteq 2^{P}$. Given a query range $R
\in {\cal R}$, the target output is $R(\vec{x}) = \sum_{p \in R}{x_p}$. Range
counting for different range spaces is a central problem in Computational
Geometry.
  We study $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private algorithms for range
counting. Our main results are for the range space given by hyperplanes, that
is, the halfspace counting problem. We present an $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differentially private algorithm for halfspace counting in $d$
dimensions which achieves $O(n^{1-1/d})$ average squared error. This contrasts
with the $\Omega(n)$ lower bound established by the classical result of Dinur
and Nissim [PODS 2003] for arbitrary subset counting queries. We also show a
matching lower bound on average squared error for any $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differentially private algorithm for halfspace counting. Both bounds
are obtained using discrepancy theory. For the lower bound, we use a modified
discrepancy measure and bound approximation of $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-differentially private algorithms for range counting queries in terms
of this discrepancy. We also relate the modified discrepancy measure to

include angular momentum channels in the pseudopotential for excited angular

accurate results. Variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations for Zn, O,

Rashba quantum wire with rough edges. The charge and spin conductances are
calculated as function of the electron energy or the wire length by adopting
the spinresolved lattice Green function method. For a single disordered Rashba
wire, it is found that the charge conductance quantization is destroyed by the
edge disorder. However, a nonzero spin conductance can be generated and its
amplitude can be manipulated by the wire length, which is attributed to the
broken structure symmetries and the spin-dependent quantum interference induced
by the rough boundaries. For a large ensemble of disordered Rashba wires, the
average charge conductance decreases monotonically, however, the average spin
conductance increases to a maximum value and then decreases, with increasing
wire length. Further study shows that the influence of the rough edges on the
charge and spin conductances can be eliminated by applying a perpendicular
magnetic field to the wire. In addition, a very large magnitude of the spin
conductance can be achieved when the electron energy lies between the two
thresholds of each pair of subbands. These findings may not only benefit to
further apprehend the transport properties of the Rashba low-dimensional
systems but also provide some theoretical instructions to the application of

  In this paper, we utilize the dyadic methods to analyze social networks, and
develop a generalized mutuality tendency theory to capture the tendencies of
those node pairs which tend to establish mutual connections more frequently
than those occur by chance. Using these results, we develop a
mutuality-tendency-aware spectral clustering algorithm to identify more stable
clusters by maximizing the within-cluster mutuality tendency and minimizing the
cross-cluster mutuality tendency. Extensive simulation results on synthetic

an important but challenging task, which can be facilitated by exploiting
structural properties of the process. In certain applications, the observed
processes are underspread, i.e., their time and frequency correlations exhibit
a reasonably fast decay, and approximately time-frequency sparse, i.e., a
reasonably large percentage of the spectral values is small. For this class of
processes, we propose a compressive estimator of the discrete Rihaczek spectrum
(RS). This estimator combines a minimum variance unbiased estimator of the RS
(which is a smoothed Rihaczek distribution using an appropriately designed
smoothing kernel) with a compressed sensing technique that exploits the
approximate time-frequency sparsity. As a result of the compression stage, the
number of measurements required for good estimation performance can be
significantly reduced. The measurements are values of the discrete ambiguity
function of the observed signal at randomly chosen time and frequency lag
positions. We provide bounds on the mean-square estimation error of both the
minimum variance unbiased RS estimator and the compressive RS estimator, and we
demonstrate the performance of the compressive estimator by means of simulation
results. The proposed compressive RS estimator can also be used for estimating
other time-dependent spectra (e.g., the Wigner-Ville spectrum) since for an
underspread process most spectra are almost equal.

for determining the inflationary entropy, based on either `bits per unit area'
or entanglement entropy. The existence of transPlanckian flat directions,
necessary for large tensor modes in the CMB, correlates with an inflationary
entropy greater than that allowed by de Sitter space. Independently these
techniques also constrain or exclude de Sitter models with large-rank gauge
groups and high UV cutoffs, such as racetrack inflation or the KKLT
construction.

has been made in the study of sparsity-constrained optimization in cases where

approximate sparse minima of cost functions of arbitrary form. Should a cost

Linearization (SRL), both of which are introduced in this paper, our algorithm
is guaranteed to produce a sparse vector within a bounded distance from the
true sparse optimum. Our approach generalizes known results for quadratic cost
functions that arise in sparse linear regression and Compressive Sensing. We
also evaluate the performance of GraSP through numerical simulations on
synthetic data, where the algorithm is employed for sparse logistic regression

photofragment-ion yields as a function of the position of the incident laser

distribution was found to be dependent on the number of loaded ions. Under high
ion-loading conditions with a significant space-charge effect, ions form a ring
profile with a maximum at the outer region of the trap, whereas they are
localized near the center axis region at low loading of the ions. These results
are explained quantitatively by a model calculation based on equilibrium
between the space-charge-induced potential and the effective potential of the
multipole rf field. The maximum adiabaticity parameter \eta_max is estimated to
be about 0.13 for the high ion-density condition in the present octopole ion
trap, which is lower than typical values reported for low ion densities; this
is probably due to additional instability caused by the space charge.

approximate query engine for running ad-hoc, interactive SQL queries on large
volumes of data. The key insight that BlinkDB builds on is that one can often
make reasonable decisions in the absence of perfect answers. For example,
reliably detecting a malfunctioning server using a distributed collection of
system logs does not require analyzing every request processed by the system.
Based on this insight, BlinkDB allows one to trade-off query accuracy for
response time, enabling interactive queries over massive data by running
queries on data samples and presenting results annotated with meaningful error
bars. To achieve this, BlinkDB uses two key ideas that differentiate it from
previous work in this area: (1) an adaptive optimization framework that builds
and maintains a set of multi-dimensional, multi-resolution samples from
original data over time, and (2) a dynamic sample selection strategy that
selects an appropriately sized sample based on a query's accuracy and/or
response time requirements. We have built an open-source version of BlinkDB and
validated its effectiveness using the well-known TPC-H benchmark as well as a
real-world analytic workload derived from Conviva Inc. Our experiments on a 100
node cluster show that BlinkDB can answer a wide range of queries from a
real-world query trace on up to 17 TBs of data in less than 2 seconds (over
100\times faster than Hive), within an error of 2 - 10%.

star formation. We particularly address the question of massive triggered star
formation near infrared bubbles. We find a strong positional correlation of
massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and H II regions with Milky Way Project
bubbles at separations of < 2 bubble radii. As bubble sizes increase, a
statistically significant overdensity of massive young sources emerges in the
region of the bubble rims, possibly indicating the occurrence of triggered star
formation. Based on numbers of bubble-associated RMS sources we find that
67+/-3% of MYSOs and (ultra)compact H II regions appear associated with a
bubble. We estimate that approximately 22+/-2% of massive young stars may have
formed as a result of feedback from expanding H II regions. Using MYSO-bubble
correlations, we serendipitously recovered the location of the recently
discovered massive cluster Mercer 81, suggesting the potential of such analyses
for discovery of heavily extincted distant clusters.

factor of 3 less than the XMM value, strongly supporting the Compton-thick

widespread, while 9.9, 25, 23.4 and 104 GHz masers are much rarer, tracing the
most energetic shocks. A survey of many southern masers at 36 and 44 GHz
suggests that these two transitions are highly complementary. The 23.4 GHz
maser is a new type of rare class I methanol maser, detected only in two
high-mass star-forming regions, G357.97-0.16 and G343.12-0.06, and showing a
behaviour similar to 9.9, 25 and 104 GHz masers. Interferometric positions
suggest that shocks responsible for class I masers could arise from a range of
phenomena, not merely an outflow scenario. For example, some masers might be
caused by interaction of an expanding HII region with its surrounding molecular
cloud. This has implications for evolutionary sequences incorporating class I
methanol masers if they appear more than once during the evolution of the
star-forming region. We also make predictions for candidate maser transitions

concentrations and vortices play an important role for the dissipation of
energy in space and astrophysical plasma. Within this work we investigate the
relation between current sheets and vortex sheets in incompressible, stationary
equilibria. For this approach it is helpful that the similar mathematical
structure of magnetohydrostatics and stationary incompressible hydrodynamics
allows us to transform static equilibria into stationary ones. The main control
function for such a transformation is the profile of the Alfven-Mach number
M_A, which is always constant along magnetic field lines, but can change from
one field line to another. In the case of a global constant M_A, vortices and
electric current concentrations are parallel. More interesting is the nonlinear
case, where M_A varies perpendicular to the field lines. This is a typical
situation at boundary layers like the magnetopause, heliopause, the solar wind
flowing around helmet streamers and at the boundary of solar coronal holes. The
corresponding current and vortex sheets show in some cases also an alignment,
but not in every case. For special density distributions in 2D it is possible
to have current but no vortex sheets. In 2D vortex sheets of field
aligned-flows can also exist without strong current sheets, taking the limit of
small Alfven Mach numbers into account. The current sheet can vanish if the
Alfven Mach number is (almost) constant and the density gradient is large
across some boundary layer. It should be emphasized that the used theory is not
only valid for small Alfven Mach numbers M_A<<1, but also for M_A~1. Connection
to other theoretical approaches and observations and physical effects in space
plasmas are presented. Differences in the various aspects of theoretical
investigations of current sheets and vortex sheets are given.

Accepted by PRD",,10.1103/PhysRevD.85.083507,,astro-ph.CO,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Stable massive neutral particles emitted by astrophysical sources undergo
deflection under the gravitational potential of our own galaxy. The deflection
angle depends on the particle velocity and therefore non-relativistic particles
will be deflected more than relativistic ones. If these particles can be
detected through neutrino telescopes, cosmic ray detectors or directional dark
matter detectors, their arrival directions would appear aligned on the sky
along the source-lens direction. On top of this deflection, the arrival
direction of non-relativistic particles is displaced with respect to the
relativistic counterpart also due to the relative motion of the source with
respect to the observer; this induces an alignment of detections along the sky
projection of the source trajectory. The final alignment will be given by a
combination of the directions induced by lensing and source proper motion. We
derive the deflection-velocity relation for the Milky Way halo and suggest that
searching for alignments on detection maps of particle telescopes could be a
way to find new particles or new astrophysical phenomena.

astrospheric tail and leaves the stellar system either as a sub-Alfvenic or as
a super-Alfvenic tail flow. An example is our own heliosphere and its
heliotail. We present an analytical method of calculating stationary,
incompressible, and field-aligned plasma flows in the astrotail of a star. We
present a recipe for constructing an astrosphere with the help of only a few
parameters, like the inner Alfven Mach number and the outer Alfven Mach number,
the magnetic field strength within and outside the stellar wind cavity, and the
distribution of singular points of the magnetic field within these flows.
Within the framework of a one-fluid approximation, it is possible to obtain
solutions of the MHD equations for stationary flows from corresponding static
MHD equilibria, by using noncanonical mappings of the canonical variables. The
canonical variables are the Euler potentials of the magnetic field of
magnetohydrostatic equilibria. Thus we start from static equilibria determined
by the distribution of magnetic neutral points, and assume that the Alfven Mach
number for the corresponding stationary equilibria is finite. The topological
structure determines the geometrical structure of the interstellar gas -
stellar wind interface. Additional boundary conditions like the outer magnetic
field and the jump of the magnetic field across the astropause allow
determination of the noncanonical transformations. This delivers the strength
of the magnetic field at every point in the astrotail region beyond the reverse
shock. The mathematical technique for describing such a scenario is applied to
astrospheres in general, but is also relevant for the heliosphere. It shows the
restrictions of the outer and the inner magnetic field strength in comparison
with the corresponding Alfven Mach numbers in the case of subalfvenic flows.

twofold, on one hand, we give the right setting for doing the calculus of
variations (including min max methods) of such functionals for immersions into
manifolds and, on the other hand, we prove existence results for possibly
branched Willmore spheres under various constraints (prescribed homotopy class,
prescribed area) or under curvature assumptions for M^m. To this aim, using the
integrability by compensation, we develop first the regularity theory for the
critical points of such functionals. We then prove a rigidity theorem
concerning the relation between CMC and Willmore spheres. Then we prove that,
for every non null 2-homotopy class, there exists a representative given by a
Lipschitz map from the 2-sphere into M^m realizing a connected family of
conformal smooth (possibly branched) area constrained Willmore spheres (as
explained in the introduction, this comes as a natural extension of the minimal
immersed spheres in homotopy class constructed by Sacks and Uhlembeck in
\cite{SaU}, in situations when they do not exist). Moreover, for every A>0 we
minimize the Willmore functional among connected families of weak, possibly
branched, immersions of the 2-sphere having prescribed total area equal to A
and we prove full regularity for the minimizer. Finally, under a mild curvature
condition on (M^m,h), we minimize the sum of the area with the square of the
L^2 norm of the second fundamental form, among weak possibly branched
immersions of the two sphere and we prove the regularity of the minimizer.

coupled to each other due to the RF and are a mix between two--stream and
parametric instabilities. The dispersion equations are derived by the
linearization of the kinetic equations for a beam--plasma system as well as the
Maxwell equations. In order to highlight the effect of the radiation field we
present a comparison of our analytical and numerical results obtained for
nonzero RF with those for vanishing RF. Assuming that the drift velocity
$\mathbf{u}_{b}$ of the beam is parallel to the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ of the
excitations two particular transversal and parallel configurations of the
polarization vector $\mathbf{E}_{0}$ of the RF with respect to $\mathbf{k}$ are

nonresonant couplings between different modes are possible. The largest growth
rates are expected at the transversal configuration when $\mathbf{E}_{0}$ is

is conformal covariant with respect to the start manifold. For the trivial case
of real or complex functions of $M$, we find again the GJMS operator, with a
leading part power to the $n/2$ of the Laplacian. When $n$ is odd, we prove

for 1976-2003. Only strong magnetic fields (B>100 G) of the equatorial region
were taken into account. The north-south asymmetry of the magnetic fluxes was
considered as well as the imbalance between positive and negative fluxes. The
north-south asymmetry displays a regular alternation of the dominant hemisphere
during the solar cycle: the northern hemisphere dominated in the ascending
phase, the southern one in the descending phase during Solar Cycles 21-23. The
sign of the imbalance did not change during the 11 years from one polar-field
reversal to the next and always coincided with the sign of the Sun's polar
magnetic field in the northern hemisphere. The dominant sign of leading
sunspots in one of the hemispheres determines the sign of the magnetic-flux
imbalance. The sign of the north-south asymmetry of the magnetic fluxes and the
sign of the imbalance of the positive and the negative fluxes are related to
the quarter of the 22-year magnetic cycle where the magnetic configuration of
the Sun remains constant (from the minimum where the sunspot sign changes
according to Hale's law to the magnetic-field reversal and from the reversal to
the minimum). The sign of the north-south asymmetry for the time interval
considered was determined by the phase of the 11-year cycle (before or after
the reversal); the sign of the imbalance of the positive and the negative
fluxes depends on both the phase of the 11-year cycle and on the parity of the
solar cycle. The results obtained demonstrate the connection of the magnetic
fields in active regions with the Sun's polar magnetic field in the northern
hemisphere.

in itself. The present paper is then the application to the Bose-Einstein
Condensation phenomena, of the harmonic analysis aspects arising from additive
and density zero perturbations, previously investigated by the author in a
separate work. Concerning the appearance of the Bose-Einstein Condensation, the
results are surprisingly in accordance with the previous ones, despite the lack
of amenability. We indeed first show the following fact. Even when the critical
density is finite (which is implied in all the models under consideration,
thanks to the appearance of the hidden spectrum), if the adjacency operator of
the graph is recurrent, it is impossible to exhibit temperature locally normal
states (i.e. states for which the local particle density is finite) describing
the condensation at all. The same occurs in the transient cases for which it is
impossible to exhibit locally normal states describing the Bose--Einstein
Condensation at mean particle density strictly greater than the critical
density . In addition, for the transient cases, in order to construct locally
normal temperature states through infinite volume limits of finite volume Gibbs
states, a careful choice of the the sequence of the finite volume chemical
potential should be done. For all such states, the condensate is essentially
allocated on the base--point supporting the perturbation. This leads that the
particle density always coincide with the critical one. It is shown that all
such temperature states are Kubo-Martin-Schwinger states for a natural
dynamics. The construction of such a dynamics, which is a very delicate issue,
is also done.

integrals obtained with this regularization can not be usually calculated

defining the beta-function are possibly integrals of total derivatives. This
feature allows to explain the origin of the exact NSVZ beta-function, relating
the beta-function with the anomalous dimensions of the matter superfields.

collide forming a bow-shaped shock structure. The Coriolis force induced by
orbital motion deflects the shocked flows, strongly affecting their dynamics.
We study the evolution of the shocked stellar and pulsar winds on scales in
which the orbital motion is important. Potential sites of non-thermal activity
are investigated. Relativistic hydrodynamical simulations in two dimensions,
performed with the code PLUTO and using the adaptive mesh refinement technique,
are used to model interacting stellar and pulsar winds on scales ~80 times the
distance between the stars. The hydrodynamical results suggest the suitable
locations of sites for particle acceleration and non-thermal emission. In
addition to the shock formed towards the star, the shocked and unshocked
components of the pulsar wind flowing away from the star terminate by means of
additional strong shocks produced by the orbital motion. Strong instabilities
lead to the development of turbulence and an effective two-wind mixing in both
the leading and trailing sides of the interaction structure, which starts to
merge with itself after one orbit. The adopted moderate pulsar-wind Lorentz
factor already provides a good qualitative description of the phenomena
involved in high-mass binaries with pulsars, and can capture important physical
effects that would not appear in non-relativistic treatments. Simulations show
that shocks, instabilities, and mass-loading yield efficient mass, momentum,
and energy exchanges between the pulsar and the stellar winds. This renders a
rapid increase in the entropy of the shocked structure, which will likely be
disrupted on scales beyond the simulated ones. Several sites of particle
acceleration and low- and high-energy emission can be identified. Doppler
boosting will have significant and complex effects on radiation.

our total sample of reddened quasars from the UKIDSS-LAS to 12 at z=1.4-2.7. At
these redshifts, Ha (6563A) is in the K-band. However, the mean Ha equivalent
width of the reddened quasars is only ten per cent larger than that of the
optically selected population and cannot explain the extreme colours. Instead,
dust extinction of Av~2-6 mags is required to reproduce the continuum colours
of our sources. This is comparable to the dust extinctions seen in
submillimetre galaxies at similar redshifts. We argue that the AGN are likely
being observed in a relatively short-lived breakout phase when they are
expelling gas and dust following a massive starburst, subsequently turning into
UV-luminous quasars. Some of our quasars show direct evidence for strong
outflows (v~800-1000 km/s) affecting the Ha line consistent with this scenario.
We predict that a larger fraction of reddened quasar hosts are likely to be
submillimetre bright compared to the UV-luminous quasar population. We use our
sample to place new constraints on the fraction of obscured Type 1 AGN likely
to be missed in optical surveys. Taken at face-value our findings suggest that
the obscured fraction depends on quasar luminosity. The space density of
obscured quasars is ~5x that inferred for UV-bright quasars from the SDSS
luminosity function at Mi<-30 but seems to drop at lower luminosities even
accounting for various sources of incompleteness in our sample (abridged).

lift introduced in Dziuk (1988). The estimates suggest that the geometric error
terms arising from the surface discretisation do not affect the overall
convergence rate of the IP method when using linear ansatz functions. This is
then verified numerically for a number of test problems. An intricate issue is
the approximation of the surface conormal required in the IP formulation,
choices of which are investigated numerically. Furthermore, we present a

for which it is known that there exists a stationary optimal policy. We
consider the algorithm Value Iteration and the sequence of policies
$\pi_1,...,\pi_k$ it implicitely generates until some iteration $k$. We provide
performance bounds for non-stationary policies involving the last $m$ generated
policies that reduce the state-of-the-art bound for the last stationary policy
$\pi_k$ by a factor $\frac{1-\gamma}{1-\gamma^m}$. In particular, the use of
non-stationary policies allows to reduce the usual asymptotic performance
bounds of Value Iteration with errors bounded by $\epsilon$ at each iteration
from $\frac{\gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2}\epsilon$ to
$\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}\epsilon$, which is significant in the usual situation
when $\gamma$ is close to 1. Given Bellman operators that can only be computed
with some error $\epsilon$, a surprising consequence of this result is that the
problem of ""computing an approximately optimal non-stationary policy"" is much
simpler than that of ""computing an approximately optimal stationary policy"",
and even slightly simpler than that of ""approximately computing the value of
some fixed policy"", since this last problem only has a guarantee of

capacitively coupled to a common resonator bus. The entire control sequence
consists of three pulses: a local Rabi pulse that excites a single qubit in the
circuit; a coupling pulse that transfers the qubit excitation to the resonator
bus; and the main, entangling operation that simultaneously couples the bus to
all N qubits. If the qubit-resonator coupling strength g is much smaller than
the qubit energy splitting, the system initially excited into the
near-degenerate single-excitation subspace stays within that subspace, while
smoothly evolving toward the fully uniform W state superposition. The duration
of the final entangling operation is found to decrease with the total number of
the qubits according to t = pi/[2gN^(1/2)], in agreement with some of the
previously proposed cavity QED W state generation schemes.

planetary systems. Eccentric, Jupiter-sized planets are particularly
interesting: they may link the ""cold"" Jupiters beyond the ice line to close-in
hot Jupiters, which are unlikely to have formed in situ. To date,
eccentricities of individual transiting planets primarily come from radial
velocity measurements. Kepler has discovered hundreds of transiting Jupiters
spanning a range of periods, but the faintness of the host stars precludes
radial velocity follow-up of most. Here we demonstrate a Bayesian method of
measuring an individual planet's eccentricity solely from its transit light
curve using prior knowledge of its host star's density. We show that eccentric
Jupiters are readily identified by their short ingress/egress/total transit
durations -- part of the ""photoeccentric"" light curve signature of a planet's
eccentricity --- even with long-cadence Kepler photometry and
loosely-constrained stellar parameters. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo exploration
of parameter posteriors naturally marginalizes over the periapse angle and
automatically accounts for the transit probability. To demonstrate, we use
three published transit light curves of HD 17156 b to measure an eccentricity
of e = 0.71 +0.16/-0.09, in good agreement with the discovery value e =
0.67+/-0.08 based on 33 radial-velocity measurements. We present two additional
tests using actual Kepler data. In each case the technique proves to be a
viable method of measuring exoplanet eccentricities and their confidence
intervals. Finally, we argue that this method is the most efficient, effective
means of identifying the extremely eccentric, proto hot Jupiters predicted by
Socrates et al. (2012).

as not to destabilize the lighter squarks. First and second generation
sfermions can be at the tens-of-TeV level which yields a decoupling solution to
the SUSY flavor and CP problems. Adopting a top-down approach, we delineate the
range of GUT scale SUSY model parameters which leads to a Natural SUSY mass
spectrum. We find natural SUSY models to be tightly constrained by the b->
s\gamma branching fraction measurement while it is also difficult but not
impossible to accommodate a light Higgs scalar of mass ~125 GeV. We present
several benchmark points which are expandable to slopes and planes. Natural
SUSY is difficult to see at LHC unless some third generation squarks are very
light. The top- and bottom- squarks cascade decay mainly to higgsino-like
charginos and neutralinos via numerous possibilities, leading to a rather
complex set of signatures. Meanwhile, a linear e^+e^- collider operating at
\sqrt{s}\sim 0.25-0.5 TeV would be a higgsino factory and is essentially
guaranteed a SUSY discovery of the low-lying charged and neutral higgsino
states. Since thermal neutralino cold dark matter is underproduced, we
conjecture that the incorporation of a Peccei-Quinn sector or light moduli into
the theory will augment higgsino dark matter production, possibly together with
an admixture of axions. We present rates for direct and indirect higgsino dark
matter detection for the case where light higgsinos dominate the dark matter
abundance.

sources. Cosbo-3, however, is not associated with the most likely radio
counterpart, closest to the MAMBO source position, but that further away from
it. This illustrates the need for intermediate-resolution (~2"") mm-observations
to identify the correct counterparts of single-dish detected SMGs. All of our
three sources become prominent only at NIR wavelengths, and their mm-to-radio
flux based redshifts suggest that they lie at redshifts z>~2. As a proof of
concept, we show that photometric redshifts can be well determined for SMGs,

luminosities of ~10^13 Lsol consistent with properties of high-redshift SMGs.

early T dwarfs, we find that the brightening of T0-T4 sources is prominent in
M$_{J}$ where there is a [1.2 - 1.4] magnitude difference. A similar yet
dampened brightening of [0.3 - 0.5] magnitude happens at M$_{H}$ and a plateau
or dimming of [-0.2 - -0.3] magnitude is seen in M$_{K}$. Comparing with
evolutionary models that vary gravity, metallicity, and cloud thickness we find
that a near constant temperature of 1200 $\pm$100 K along a narrow spectral
subtype of T0-T4 is required to account for the brightening and color magnitude
diagram of the L-dwarf/T-dwarf transition. Furthermore, there is a significant
population of both L and T dwarfs which are red or potentially ""ultra-cloudy""

sphaleron-proof, and survives down to the weak scale without being erased by

extragalactic standard candle. In theory, the PNLF method should not work at
all, since the luminosities of the brightest planetary nebulae (PNe) should be
highly sensitive to the age of their host stellar population. Yet the method
appears robust, as it consistently produces < 10% distances to galaxies of all
Hubble types, from the earliest ellipticals to the latest-type spirals and
irregulars. It is therefore uniquely suited for cross-checking the results of
other techniques and finding small offsets between the Population I and
Population II distance ladders. We review the calibration of the method and
show that the zero points provided by Cepheids and the Tip of the Red Giant
Branch are in excellent agreement. We then compare the results of the PNLF with
those from Surface Brightness Fluctuation measurements, and show that, although
both techniques agree in a relative sense, the latter method yields distances
that are ~15% larger than those from the PNLF. We trace this discrepancy back
to the calibration galaxies and argue that, due to a small systematic error
associated with internal reddening, the true distance scale likely falls
between the extremes of the two methods. We also demonstrate how PNLF
measurements in the early-type galaxies that have hosted Type Ia supernovae can
help calibrate the SN Ia maximum magnitude-rate of decline relation. Finally,
we discuss how the results from space missions such as Kepler and Gaia can help
our understanding of the PNLF phenomenon and improve our knowledge of the
physics of local planetary nebulae.

the $AdS_4$ higher-spin gauge theory shown to be dual to the theory of 3d
conformal currents of all spins interacting with 3d conformal higher-spin
fields of Chern-Simons type. Generally, the resulting 3d boundary conformal
theory is nonlinear, providing an interacting version of the 3d boundary sigma
model conjectured by Klebanov and Polyakov to be dual to the $AdS_4$ HS theory
in the large $N$ limit. Being a gauge theory it escapes the conditions of the
theorem of Maldacena and Zhiboedov, which force a 3d boundary conformal theory
to be free. Two reductions of particular higher-spin gauge theories where
boundary higher-spin gauge fields decouple from the currents and which have
free boundary duals are identified. Higher-spin holographic duality is also
discussed for the cases of $AdS_3/CFT_2$ and duality between higher-spin

chemistry is solved as a function of time with three networks: one purely
gas-phase, one that includes accretion and desorption, and one, the complete
gas-grain network, that includes surface chemistry in addition. We compare our
results with observed molecular abundances for two representative IRDCs --
IRDC013.90-1 and IRDC321.73-1 -- using the molecular species N$_2$H$^+$,
HC$_3$N, HNC, HCO$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H, NH$_3$ and CS. IRDC013.90-1 is a cold IRDC,

well, but that the goodness-of-fit is not sharply peaked at a particular
temperature. Surface processes are important for the explanation of the high
gas-phase abundance of N$_2$H$^+$ in IRDC321.73-1. The general success of the

difference. It is found weak and strong scatterings strength affect the
electron transport in different ways. In the case of weak scattering strength,
electron trapping increase the electron density, hereafter boost the
conductance significantly. Although the increment in conductance would reduce
the Seebeck coefficient slightly, the power factor still increases. In the case
of strong scattering strength, electron diffraction causes the redistribution
of electrons, accumulation of electron at the ends of the wire blocks current
flow; hence the conductance is reduced significantly. Although the Seebeck
coefficient increases slightly, the power factor still decreases. The power

Systems studied include 16O+16O, 16O+24O, 24O+24O, 12C+16O, and 12C+24O. We
find remarkable agreement with experimental cross sections for the fusion of
stable nuclei. Our simulations use the SLy4 Skyrme force that has been
previously fit to the properties of stable nuclei, and no parameters have been
fit to fusion data. We compare our results to the simple S\~{a}o Paulo static
barrier penetration model. For the asymmetric systems 12C+24O or 16O+24O we
predict an order of magnitude larger cross section than those predicted by the
S\~{a}o Paulo model. This is likely due to the transfer of neutrons from the
very neutron rich nucleus to the stable nucleus and dynamical rearrangements of
the nuclear densities during the collision process. These effects are not
included in potential models. This enhancement of fusion cross sections, for
very neutron rich nuclei, can be tested in the laboratory with radioactive
beams.

global well-posedness is proved under the condition that the initial data are

of viscous dissipation. We use several new techniques to overcome the

the first result concerning $k$-$\varepsilon$ model equations.

crucial role in various astrophysical processes, including star formation,
accretion of matter, transport processes (e.g., transport of heat), and cosmic
rays. We identified a process ""ground state alignment"" as a new way to
determine the magnetic field direction in diffuse medium. The alignment is due
to anisotropic radiation impinging on the atom/ion, while the magnetic field
induces precession and realign the atom/ion and therefore the polarization of
the emitted or absorbed radiation reflects the direction of the magnetic field.
The atoms get aligned at their low levels and, as the life-time of the
atoms/ions we deal with is long, the alignment induced by anisotropic radiation
is susceptible to weak magnetic fields ($1{\rm G}\gtrsim B\gtrsim 10^{-15}$G).
Compared to the upper level Hanle effect, atomic realignment is most suitable
for the studies of magnetic field in the diffuse medium, where magnetic field
is relatively weak. In fact, the effects of atomic/ionic alignment, including
the realignment in magnetic field, were studied in the laboratory decades ago,
mostly in relation to the maser research. Recently, the atomic effect has been
already detected in observations from circumstellar medium and this is a
harbinger of future extensive magnetic field studies. A unique feature of the
atomic realignment is that they can reveal the 3D orientation of magnetic
field. In this article, we shall review the basic physical processes involved
in atomic realignment and its applications to interplanetary, circumstellar and
interstellar magnetic fields. In addition, our research reveals that the
polarization of the radiation arising from the transitions between fine and
hyperfine states of the ground level can provide a unique diagnostics of
magnetic fields, including those in the Early Universe.

Michel,Causal conditioning and instantaneous coupling in causality graphs,submitted,,,,cs.IT math.IT,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  The paper investigates the link between Granger causality graphs recently
formalized by Eichler and directed information theory developed by Massey and
Kramer. We particularly insist on the implication of two notions of causality
that may occur in physical systems. It is well accepted that dynamical
causality is assessed by the conditional transfer entropy, a measure appearing
naturally as a part of directed information. Surprisingly the notion of
instantaneous causality is often overlooked, even if it was clearly understood
in early works. In the bivariate case, instantaneous coupling is measured
adequately by the instantaneous information exchange, a measure that
supplements the transfer entropy in the decomposition of directed information.
In this paper, the focus is put on the multivariate case and conditional graph
modeling issues. In this framework, we show that the decomposition of directed
information into the sum of transfer entropy and information exchange does not
hold anymore. Nevertheless, the discussion allows to put forward the two
measures as pillars for the inference of causality graphs. We illustrate this
on two synthetic examples which allow us to discuss not only the theoretical
concepts, but also the practical estimation issues.

critical time, at which material yields, increases with increase in aging time

advantage of an isolobal analogy that can be established between the orbitals
spanning the active spaces of the different substituted dyes. The solutions of
the chemical problem are expressed in a diabatic Hilbert space that is
analogous to classical resonance models. The effective Hamiltonians for all
dyes can be fit to a single functional form that depends on the mixing angle
between a bridge-charged diabatic state and a superposition representing the
canonical resonance. We find that the structure of the bridge-charged state
changes in a regular fashion across the series. The change is consistent with
an inversion of the sign of the charge carrier on the bridge, which changes
from an electron pair to a hole as the series is traversed.

$SO(8)\xz SO(n)$ and rigid SO(8,n) symmetries, are discussed in a superspace
setting starting from the superconformal theory. The on-shell theory is
obtained by imposing further constraints; it is essentially a non-linear sigma
model that induces a Poincar\'e supergeometry. The deformations of the geometry
due to gauging are briefly discussed. The possible $p$-form field strengths are
studied using supersymmetry and SO(8,n) symmetry. The set of such forms obeying
consistent Bianchi identities constitutes a Lie super co-algebra while the
demand that these identities admit solutions places a further constraint on the
possible representations of SO(8,n) that the forms transform under which can be
easily understood using superspace cohomology. The dual Lie superalgebra can
then be identified as the positive sector of a Borcherds superalgebra that
extends the Lie algebra of the duality group. In addition to the known
$p=2,3,4$ forms, which we construct explicitly, there are five-forms that can
be non-zero in supergravity, while all forms with $p>5$ vanish. It is shown
that some six-forms can have non-trivial contributions at order $\a'$.

ellipticities than most of GCs in M31 and the Milky Way. Their large
ellipticities may be due to galaxy tides coming from satellite dwarf galaxies

are lost when the relativistic universe is approximated, or rather replaced, by
a Newtonian one. This is the main purpose of our investigation. We first define
Newtonian cosmology and we give an overview on general relativity, both in its
standard and covariant formulations. We show how the two theories deal with
inhomogeneous cosmological models and we introduce the backreaction conjecture.
Then we review on how Newtonian gravity and general relativity relate to each
other in the fully non-linear regime. For this purpose we discuss frame theory.
We carry out the same investigation also in the weak-field, small-velocity
limit of general relativity, and we derive the Newtonian limit resorting to the
framework of post-Newtonian cosmology. Finally we remark that there are
solutions of Newtonian gravity which do not have any relativistic counterpart.

quantum dynamics is that the quantum trajectories subject to typical `guiding'
wavefunctions turn to be quite irregular, i.e. {\it chaotic} (in the dynamical
systems' sense). In the present paper, we consider mainly cases in which the
quantum trajectories are {\it ordered}, i.e. they have zero Lyapunov
characteristic numbers. We use perturbative methods to establish the existence
of such trajectories from a theoretical point of view, while we analyze their
properties via numerical experiments. Using a 2D harmonic oscillator system, we
first establish conditions under which a trajectory can be shown to avoid close
encounters with a moving nodal point, thus avoiding the source of chaos in this
system. We then consider series expansions for trajectories both in the
interior and the exterior of the domain covered by nodal lines, probing the
domain of convergence as well as how successful the series are in comparison
with numerical computations or regular trajectories. We then examine a
H\'{e}non - Heiles system possessing regular trajectories, thus generalizing
previous results. Finally, we explore a key issue of physical interest in the
context of the de Broglie - Bohm formalism, namely the influence of order in
the so-called {\it quantum relaxation} effect. We show that the existence of
regular trajectories poses restrictions to the quantum relaxation process, and
we give examples in which the relaxation is suppressed even when we consider
initial ensembles of only chaotic trajectories, provided, however, that the
system as a whole is characterized by a certain degree of order.

intensity ratio of 13CO J=3-2 and 13CO J=2-1 shows the distribution of the
temperature with two peaks, which don't coincide with IRAS22475+5939 source and
the center of the HII region, but at the edge of the HII region. The overlays
of the Spitzer IRAC 8um and CO contours indicate that they are associated with
each other and the strongest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emission
is at the position of IRAS22475+5939 source. While the IRAS LRS spectrum at
7-23 um and the PHT-s spectrum at 2-12 um of IRAS22475+5939 source also exhibit
strong PAHs emission characters at the main PAH bands. The diversity of PAH
family should be responsible for the plateaus of PAHs emission in the PHT-s
spectrum and the IRAS-LRS spectrum. An analysis and modeling in infrared bands
suggest that IRAS22475+5939 is more likely to be a Class I YSO. Where this is
the case, the star is likely to have a temperature T_{EFF} \sim 9995.8 K, mass
\sim15.34 M_(sun), luminosity \sim 1.54*10^4 L_(sun) and age \sim 1.54*10^4 yr.

wavelength between 1 and 10 um, otherwise, envelope fluxes for lambda >10 um.

of neutral and mildly ionised gas in the Milky Way halo, based on a large
absorption-selected data set. Multi-wavelength studies were performed combining
optical absorption line data of CaII and NaI with follow-up HI 21-cm emission
line observations along 408 sight lines towards low- and high-redshift QSOs. We
made use of archival optical spectra obtained with UVES/VLT. HI data were
extracted from the Effelsberg-Bonn HI survey and the Galactic All-Sky survey.
For selected sight lines we obtained deeper follow-up observations using the
Effelsberg 100-m telescope. CaII (NaI) halo absorbers at intermediate and high
radial velocities are present in 40-55% (20-35%) of the sightlines, depending
on the column density threshold chosen. Many halo absorbers show
multi-component absorption lines, indicating the presence of sub-structure. In
65% of the cases, absorption is associated with HI 21-cm emission. The CaII
(NaI) column density distribution function follows a power-law with a slope of
-2.2 (-1.4). Our absorption-selected survey confirms our previous results that
the Milky Way halo is filled with a large number of neutral gas structures
whose high column density tail represents the population of common HI high- and
intermediate-velocity clouds seen in 21-cm observations. We find that CaII/NaI
column density ratios in the halo absorbers are typically smaller than those in
the Milky Way disc, in the gas in the Magellanic Clouds, and in damped
Lyman-alpha systems. The small ratios (prominent in particular in high-velocity

close to that of a Hilbert space for our results to hold. A full set of

energy density of a family of solutions. We consider two cases: when the set of
points where the ellipticity of the Heat operator fails is included in a
hypersurface and when it is an open set. In the first case and under special
assumptions, we prove that the evolution of the energy density is the one of a
damped wave equation: propagation along the rays of geometric optic and damping
according to a microlocal process. In the second case, we show that the energy
density propagates along rays which are distortions of the rays of geometric
optic.

enable us to characterize the coupling between bismuth donor spin qubits in Si

Decoupling from the spin bath is predicted and cluster correlation expansion
simulations show near-complete suppression of spin diffusion, at optimal
working points. The suppression takes the form of sharply peaked divergences of
the spin diffusion coherence time, in contrast with previously identified
broader regions of insensitivity to classical fluctuations. ENDOR data suggest
that anisotropic contributions are comparatively weak, so the form of the
divergences is largely independent of crystal orientation.

group ISO(2,1) on manifolds RxS, where S is a punctured oriented surface of
general genus. For all gauge fixing conditions that satisfy certain structural
requirements, this yields an explicit description of the Poisson structure on
the moduli space of flat ISO(2,1)-connections on S via the resulting Dirac
bracket. The Dirac bracket is determined by classical dynamical r-matrices for
ISO(2,1). We show that the Poisson structures and classical dynamical
r-matrices arising from different gauge fixing conditions are related by
dynamical ISO(2,1)-valued transformations that generalise the usual gauge
transformations of classical dynamical r-matrices. By means of these
transformations, it is possible to classify all Poisson structures and
classical dynamical r-matrices obtained from such gauge fixings. Generically
these Poisson structures combine classical dynamical r-matrices for
non-conjugate Cartan subalgebras of iso(2,1).

$k\ge3$ Normal populations to estimate its own population mean $\mu_i$ can be
improved upon uniformly for every possible $\mu=(\mu_1,...,\mu_k)'$. The
dominating estimators, referred to here as being ""Model-I minimax,"" can be
found by shrinking the sample means toward any constant vector. Admissible
minimax shrinkage estimators were derived by Stein and others as posterior
means based on a random effects model, ""Model-II"" here, wherein the $\mu_i$
values have their own distributions. Section 2 centers on Figure 2, which
organizes a wide class of priors on the unknown Level-II hyperparameters that
have been proved to yield admissible Model-I minimax shrinkage estimators in
the ""equal variance case."" Putting a flat prior on the Level-II variance is
unique in this class for its scale-invariance and for its conjugacy, and it
induces Stein's harmonic prior (SHP) on $\mu_i$.

gain is derived. Many closed-form critical conditions for various control
schemes in terms of converter parameters are also derived. Some previously
known critical conditions become special cases in the generalized framework.
Given an arbitrary control scheme, a systematic procedure is proposed to derive
the critical condition for that control scheme. Different control schemes share
similar forms of critical conditions. For example, both V2 control and voltage
mode control have the same form of critical condition. A peculiar phenomenon in
average current mode control where subharmonic oscillation occurs in a window
value of pole can be explained by the derived critical condition. A ripple
amplitude index to predict subharmonic oscillation proposed in the past
research has limited application and is shown invalid for a converter with a
large pole.

  J. Zweizig","The characterization of Virgo data and its impact on gravitational-wave
  searches","50 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables",,10.1088/0264-9381/29/15/155002,,gr-qc,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  Between 2007 and 2010 Virgo collected data in coincidence with the LIGO and
GEO gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. These data have been searched for GWs
emitted by cataclysmic phenomena in the universe, by non-axisymmetric rotating
neutron stars or from a stochastic background in the frequency band of the
detectors. The sensitivity of GW searches is limited by noise produced by the
detector or its environment. It is therefore crucial to characterize the
various noise sources in a GW detector. This paper reviews the Virgo detector
noise sources, noise propagation, and conversion mechanisms which were
identified in the three first Virgo observing runs. In many cases, these
investigations allowed us to mitigate noise sources in the detector, or to
selectively flag noise events and discard them from the data. We present
examples from the joint LIGO-GEO-Virgo GW searches to show how well noise
transients and narrow spectral lines have been identified and excluded from the
Virgo data. We also discuss how detector characterization can improve the
astrophysical reach of gravitational-wave searches.

astronomy at mm wavelengths. The Antarctic plateau is recognized to be an ideal
site for mm and sub-mm observations, and the French/Italian base of Dome C is
among the best sites on Earth for these observations. In this paper we present
measurements, performed using the BRAIN-pathfinder experiment, at Dome C of the
atmospheric emission in intensity and polarization at 150GHz, one of the best
observational frequencies for CMB observations when considering cosmic signal
intensity, atmospheric transmission, detectors sensitivity, and foreground
removal. Careful characterization of the air-mass synchronous emission has been
performed, acquiring more that 380 elevation scans (i.e. ""skydip"") during the
third BRAIN-pathfinder summer campaign in December 2009/January 2010. The
extremely high transparency of the Antarctic atmosphere over Dome Concordia is
proven by the very low measured optical depth: <tau_I>=0.050 \pm 0.003 \pm
0.011 where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic error.
Mid term stability, over the summer campaign, of the atmosphere emission has
also been studied. Adapting the radiative transfer atmosphere emission model
""am"" to the particular conditions found at Dome C, we also infer the level of
the PWV content of the atmosphere, notoriously the main source of disturbance
in millimetric astronomy (<PWV>=0.77 +/- 0.06 + 0.15 - 0.12 mm). Upper limits
on the air-mass correlated polarized signal are also placed for the first time.
The degree of circular polarization of atmospheric emission is found to be
lower than 0.2% (95%CL), while the degree of linear polarization is found to be
lower than 0.1% (95%CL). These limits include signal-correlated instrumental
spurious polarization.

inertial mass m. While the ABBM model can be solved exactly, its extension to
inertia exhibits complicated history dependence due to oscillations and
backward motion. The characteristic scales for avalanche motion are studied
from numerics and qualitative arguments. To make analytical progress we
consider two variants which coincide with the original model whenever the
particle moves only forward. Using a combination of analytical and numerical
methods together with simulations, we characterize the distributions of
instantaneous acceleration and velocity, and compare them in these three
models. We show that for large driving velocity, all three models share the

analytically for small and large m, as well as for m =6/25. The effect of small

theories are often considered as a special case of a much more general
framework of generalized probabilistic theories. We first present a detailed
introduction to generalized probabilistic theories before we examine new
approaches towards a physical axiomatization of quantum theory. The main result
of the thesis is that one postulate concerning post-measurement states (which
have gained almost no attention in this context so far) is sufficient to rule
out all probabilistic theories with a polytopic state space, except for
classical theory. The postulate states that a measurement with a definite
outcome does not alter the state. This rules out almost all toy theories
considered so far, for instance the PR-box, but is compatible with quantum
theory. Thus, this result can be seen as an approach towards a classification
of quantum theory in physical terms. It only deals with local state spaces, in
contrast to other approaches that are mostly concerned with nonlocality in
composite systems.

by numerical simulations. The lattice system shows a dimensionally-reduced
phase where the extra dimension is small compared to the four dimensional
correlation length. In the low-energy regime of this phase, the system behaves
like a four-dimensional gauge theory coupled to an adjoint scalar field. By
tuning the bare parameters of the lattice model, we identify lines of constant
physics, and analyse the behaviour of the non-perturbative scalar mass as a
function of the compactification and the cut-off scales. The perturbative
prediction that the effective theory contains a light particle with a mass that
is independent of the cut-off is tested against non-pertubative results.

means of managing heat in nanoscale structures and of controlling spin
information by using heat flow. Thermal magnons (spin-wave quanta) are expected
to play a major role, however, little is known about the underlying physical
mechanisms involved. The reason is the lack of information about magnon
interactions and of reliable methods to obtain it, in particular for electrical
conductors because of the intricate influence of electrons. Here, we
demonstrate a conceptually new device that allows us to gather information on
magnon-electron scattering and magnon-drag effects. The device resembles a
thermopile formed by a large number of pairs of ferromagnetic wires placed
between a hot and a cold source and connected thermally in parallel and
electrically in series. By controlling the relative orientation of the
magnetization in pairs of wires, the magnon-drag can be studied independently
of the electron and phonon-drag thermoelectric effects. Measurements as a
function of temperature reveal the effect on magnon drag following a variation
of magnon and phonon populations. This information is crucial to understand the
physics of electron-magnon interactions, magnon dynamics and thermal spin
transport.

decoherence will lessen and close the gap between them. To understand this
process, it is necessary to investigate the evolution of quantum walk under
different situation of decoherence. In this article, we study a non-Markovian
decoherent quantum walk on a line. In the short time regime, the behavior of
the walk deviates from both idea quantum walks and classical random walks. The
position variance as a measure of quantum walk starts oscillating from the
first several steps and tends to be linear on time and showing a diffusive
spread in the long time limit, which is caused by the non-Markovian dephasing
affecting on quantum correlations between quantum walker and his coin. We also
study both quantum discord and measurement-induced disturbance as measures of
quantum correlations and observe that both of them oscillate in the short time
regime and tend to be zero in the long time limit. Therefore quantum walk with
non-Markovian decoherence tends to diffusive spreading behavior in the long
time limit, while in the short time regime it oscillates between a ballistic
and diffusive spreading behavior, and the quantum correlation collapses and
revivals due to the memory effect.

own Milky-Way Galaxy with high resolution $N$-body simulations of a Milky-Way
like dark matter halo, assuming different nature of WIMPs. Due to the large
free-streaming length in the scenario of warm WIMPs, the substructure contend
of the dark matter halo is significantly different from that of the cold WIMP
counterpart, resulting in distinct predictions of the $\gamma$-ray signals from
the dark matter annihilation. We illustrate these by comparing the predicted
$\gamma$-ray signals from the warm WIMP annihilation to that of cold WIMPs.
Pronounced differences from the subhalo skymap and statistical properties
between two WIMP models are demonstrated. Due to the potentially enhanced cross
section of the non-thermal production mechanism in warm WIMP scenario, the
Galactic center might be prior for the indirect detection of warm WIMPs to
dwarf galaxies, which might be different from the cold dark matter scenario. As

assumed that the medium lacks a center of inversion and the dependence of the
electric displacement on the electric field can be approximated by an
exponential function. We show that the Maxwell equations are integrated exactly
in this case and the field components in the cavity are represented in terms of
implicit functions of special form. The driven electromagnetic oscillations in

property between the minimum-mean square error (MMSE) in the estimation of the

the MMSE assuming an arbitrary input. This paper extends the result to the
parallel MIMO additive Gaussian channel in three phases: i) The channel matrix
is the identity matrix, and we limit the Gaussian input to a vector of Gaussian
i.i.d. elements. The ""single crossing point"" property is with respect to the
snr (as in the scalar case). ii) The channel matrix is arbitrary, the Gaussian
input is limited to an independent Gaussian input. A ""single crossing point""
property is derived for each diagonal element of the MMSE matrix. iii) The
Gaussian input is allowed to be an arbitrary Gaussian random vector. A ""single
crossing point"" property is derived for each eigenvalue of the MMSE matrix.

properties on the mutual information, using the fundamental relationship
between estimation theory and information theory. The results of the last phase
are also translated to a new property of Fisher's information. Finally, the
applicability of all three extensions on information theoretic problems is
demonstrated through: a proof of a special case of Shannon's vector EPI, a
converse proof of the capacity region of the parallel degraded MIMO broadcast
channel (BC) under per-antenna power constrains and under covariance
constraints, and a converse proof of the capacity region of the compound
